</div>

<p>In the fifty-two short essays of this volume I
have presented familiar objects from unusual
points of view. Bird&#8217;s-eye glances and insect&#8217;s-eye
glances, at the nature of our woods and fields,
will reveal beauties which are wholly invisible
from the usual human view-point, five feet or
more above the ground.</p>
<p>Who follows the lines must expect to find
moods as varying as the seasons; to face storm
and night and cold, and all other delights of what
wildness still remains to us upon the earth.</p>
<p>Emphasis has been laid upon the weak points
in our knowledge of things about us, and the
principal desire of the author is to inspire enthusiasm
in those whose eyes are just opening to
the wild beauties of God&#8217;s out-of-doors, to gather
up and follow to the end some of these frayed-out
threads of mystery.</p>
<p>Portions of the text have been published at
various times in the pages of &#8220;Outing,&#8221; &#8220;Recreation,&#8221;

<h2>BIRDS OF THE SNOW</h2>
</div>

<p>No fact of natural history is more interesting,
or more significant of the poetry of evolution,
than the distribution of birds over the entire
surface of the world. They have overcome countless
obstacles, and adapted themselves to all conditions.
The last faltering glance which the Arctic
explorer sends toward his coveted goal, ere he
admits defeat, shows flocks of snow buntings
active with warm life; the storm-tossed mariner
in the midst of the sea, is followed, encircled, by
the steady, tireless flight of the albatross; the
fever-stricken wanderer in tropical jungles listens
to the sweet notes of birds amid the stagnant
pools; while the thirsty traveller in the desert is
ever watched by the distant buzzards. Finally
when the intrepid climber, at the risk of life and
limb, has painfully made his way to the summit
of the most lofty peak, far, far above him, in the
blue expanse of thin air, he can distinguish the
form of a majestic eagle or condor.</p>
<p>At the approach of winter the flowers and
insects about us die, but most of the birds take
wing and fly to a more temperate climate, while
their place is filled with others which have spent
the summer farther to the north. Thus without
stirring from our doorway we may become
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
acquainted with many species whose summer
homes are hundreds of miles away.</p>
<p>No time is more propitious or advisable for the
amateur bird lover to begin his studies than the
first of the year. Bird life is now reduced to its
simplest terms in numbers and species, and the
absence of concealing foliage, together with the
usual tameness of winter birds, makes identification
an easy matter.</p>
<p>In January and the succeeding month we have
with us birds which are called permanent residents,
which do not leave us throughout the entire
year; and, in addition, the winter visitors which
have come to us from the far north.</p>
<p>In the uplands we may flush ruffed grouse from
their snug retreats in the snow; while in the weedy
fields, many a fairy trail shows where bob-white
has passed, and often he will announce his own
name from the top of a rail fence. The grouse
at this season have a curious outgrowth of horny
scales along each side of the toes, which, acting
as a tiny snowshoe, enables them to walk on soft
snow with little danger of sinking through.</p>
<p>Few of our winter birds can boast of bright
colours; their garbs are chiefly grays and browns,
but all have some mark or habit or note by which
they can be at once named. For example, if you
see a mouse hitching spirally up a tree-trunk, a
closer look will show that it is a brown creeper,
seeking tiny insects and their eggs in the crevices
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
of the trunk. He looks like a small piece of the
roughened bark which has suddenly become animated.
His long tail props him up and his tiny
feet never fail to find a foothold. Our winter
birds go in flocks, and where we see a brown
creeper we are almost sure to find other birds.</p>
<p>Nuthatches are those blue-backed, white or
rufous breasted little climbers who spend their
lives defying the law of gravity. They need no
supporting tail, and have only the usual number
of eight toes, but they traverse the bark, up or
down, head often pointing toward the ground,
as if their feet were small vacuum cups. Their
note is an odd nasal <i>nyêh!</i> <i>nyêh!</i></p>
<p>In winter some one species of bird usually predominates,
most often, perhaps, it is the black-capped
chickadee. They seem to fill every grove,
and, if you take your stand in the woods, flock
after flock will pass in succession. What good
luck must have come to the chickadee race during
the preceding summer? Was some one of their
enemies stricken with a plague, or did they show
more than usual care in the selecting of their
nesting holes? Whatever it was, during such a
year, it seems certain that scores more of chickadee
babies manage to live to grow up than is
usually the case. These little fluffs are, in their
way, as remarkable acrobats as are the nuthatches,
and it is a marvel how the very thin legs,
with their tiny sliver of bone and thread of tendon,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
can hold the body of the bird in almost any position,
while the vainly hidden clusters of insect
eggs are pried into. Without ceasing a moment
in their busy search for food, the fluffy feathered
members of the flock call to each other, &#8220;<i>Chick-a-chick-a-dee-dee!</i>&#8221;
but now and then the heart of
some little fellow bubbles over, and he rests an
instant, sending out a sweet, tender, high call, a
&#8220;<i>Ph&oelig;-be!</i>&#8221; love note, which warms our ears in
the frosty air and makes us feel a real affection
for the brave little mites.</p>
<p>Our song sparrow is, like the poor, always with
us, at least near the coast, but we think none the
less of him for that, and besides, that fact is true
in only one sense. A ripple in a stream may be
seen day after day, and yet the water forming it
is never the same, it is continually flowing onward.
This is usually the case with song sparrows and
with most other birds which are present summer
and winter. The individual sparrows which flit
from bush to bush, or slip in and out of the brush
piles in January, have doubtless come from some
point north of us, while the song sparrows of our
summer walks are now miles to the southward.
Few birds remain the entire year in the locality
in which they breed, although the southward
movement may be a very limited one. When birds
migrate so short a distance, they are liable to be
affected in colour and size by the temperature
and dampness of their respective areas; and so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
we find that in North America there are as many
as twenty-two races of song sparrows, to each of
which has been given a scientific name. When you
wish to speak of our northeastern song sparrow
in the latest scientific way, you must say
<i>Melospiza cinerea melodia</i>, which tells us that it
is a melodious song finch, ashy or brown in colour.</p>
<p>Our winter sparrows are easy to identify. The
song sparrow may, of course, be known by the
streaks of black and brown upon his breast and
sides, and by the blotch which these form in the
centre of the breast. The tree sparrow, which
comes to us from Hudson Bay and Labrador,
lacks the stripes, but has the centre spot. This is
one of our commonest field birds in winter, notwithstanding
his name.</p>
<p>The most omnipresent and abundant of all our
winter visitors from the north are the juncos, or
snowbirds. Slate coloured above and white below,
perfectly describes these birds, although their distinguishing
mark, visible a long way off, is the
white V in their tails, formed by several white
outer feathers on each side. The sharp chirps of
juncos are heard before the ice begins to form,
and they stay with us all winter.</p>
<p>We have called the junco a snowbird, but this
name should really be confined to a black and
white bunting which comes south only with a mid-winter&#8217;s
rush of snowflakes. Their warm little
bodies nestle close to the white crystals, and they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
seek cheerfully for the seeds which nature has
provided for them. Then a thaw comes, and they
disappear as silently and mysteriously as if they
had melted with the flakes; but doubtless they are
far to the northward, hanging on the outskirts of
the Arctic storms, and giving way only when every
particle of food is frozen tight, the ground covered
deep with snow, and the panicled seed clusters
locked in crystal frames of ice.</p>
<p>The feathers of these Arctic wanderers are
perfect non-conductors of heat and of cold, and
never a chill reaches their little frames until
hunger presses. Then they must find food and
quickly, or they die. When these snowflakes first
come to us they are tinged with gray and brown,
but gradually through the winter their colours
become more clear-cut and brilliant, until, when
spring comes, they are garbed in contrasting
black and white. With all this change, however,
they leave never a feather with us, but only the
minute brown tips of the feather vanes, which, by
wearing away, leave exposed the clean new
colours beneath.</p>
<p>Thus we find that there are problems innumerable
to verify and to solve, even when the tide of
the year&#8217;s life is at its lowest ebb.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
<h2>WINTER MARVELS</h2>
</div>

<p>Let us suppose that a heavy snow has fallen
and that we have been a-birding in vain.
For once it seems as if all the birds had gone the
way of the butterflies. But we are not true bird-lovers
unless we can substitute nature for bird
whenever the occasion demands; specialisation is
only for the ultra-scientist.</p>
<p>There is more to be learned in a snowy field
than volumes could tell. There is the tangle of
footprints to unravel, the history of the pastimes
and foragings and tragedies of the past night
writ large and unmistakable. Though the sun now
shines brightly, we can well imagine the cold darkness
of six hours ago; we can reconstruct the
whole scene from those tiny tracks, showing frantic
leaps, the indentation of two wing-tips,&mdash;a
speck of blood. But let us take a bird&#8217;s-eye view
of things, from a bird&#8217;s-head height; that is, lie
flat upon a board or upon the clean, dry crystals
and see what wonders we have passed by all our
lives.</p>
<p>Take twenty square feet of snow with a streamlet
through the centre, and we have an epitome of
geological processes and conditions. With chin
upon mittens and mittens upon the crust, the eye
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
opens upon a new world. The half-covered rivulet
becomes a monster glacier-fed stream, rushing
down through grand canyons and caves, hung with
icy stalactites. Bit by bit the walls are undermined
and massive icebergs become detached and
are whirled away. As for moraines, we have them
in plenty; only the windrows of thousands upon
thousands of tiny seeds of which they are composed,
are not permanent, but change their form
and position with every strong gust of wind. And
with every gust too their numbers increase, the
harvest of the weeds being garnered here, upon
barren ground. No wonder the stream will be
hidden from view next summer, when the myriad
seeds sprout and begin to fight upward for light
and air.</p>
<p>If we cannot hope for polar bears to complete
our Arctic scene, we may thrill at the sight of a
sinuous weasel, winding his way among the
weeds; and if we look in vain for swans, we at
least may rejoice in a whirling, white flock of snow
buntings.</p>
<p>A few flakes fall gently upon our sleeve and
another world opens before us. A small hand-lens
will be of service, although sharp eyes may
dispense with it. Gather a few recently fallen
flakes upon a piece of black cloth, and the lens will
reveal jewels more beautiful than any ever
fashioned by the hand of man. Six-pointed crystals,
always hexagonal, of a myriad patterns,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
leave us lost in wonderment when we look out over
the white landscape and think of the hidden beauty
of it all. The largest glacier of Greenland or
Alaska is composed wholly of just such crystals
whose points have melted and which have become
ice.</p>
<p>We may draw or photograph scores of these
beautiful crystals and never duplicate a figure.
Some are almost solid and tabular, others are
simple stars or fern-branched. Then we may
detect compound forms, crystals within crystals,
and, rarest of all, doubles, where two different
forms appear as joined together by a tiny pillar.
In all of these we have an epitome of the crystals
of the rocks beneath our feet, only in their case
the pressure has moulded them into straight columns,
while the snow, forming unhindered in midair,
resolves itself into these exquisite forms and
floral designs. Flowers and rocks are not so very
unlike after all.</p>
<p>Few of us can observe these wonderful forms
without feeling the poetry of it all. Thoreau on
the fifth day of January, 1856, writes as follows:...
&#8220;The thin snow now driving from the north
and lodging on my coat consists of those beautiful
star crystals, not cottony and chubby spokes
as on the 13th of December, but thin and partly
transparent crystals. They are about one tenth
of an inch in diameter, perfect little wheels with
six spokes, without a tire, or rather with six perfect
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
little leaflets, fern-like, with a distinct,
straight, slender midrib raying from the centre.
On each side of each midrib there is a transparent,
thin blade with a crenate edge. How full of the
creative genius is the air in which these are generated!
I should hardly admire more if real stars
fell and lodged on my coat. Nature is full of
genius, full of the divinity, so that not a snowflake
escapes its fashioning hand. Nothing is
cheap and coarse, neither dewdrops nor snowflakes.
Soon the storm increases (it was already
very severe to face), and the snow becomes finer,
more white and powdery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who knows but this is the original form of all
snowflakes, but that, when I observe these crystal
stars falling around me, they are only just generated
in the low mist next the earth. I am nearer
to the source of the snow, its primal auroral, and
golden hour of infancy; commonly the flakes reach
us travel-worn and agglomerated, comparatively,
without order or beauty, far down in their fall,
like men in their advanced age. As for the circumstances
under which this occurs, it is quite
cold, and the driving storm is bitter to face, though
very little snow is falling. It comes almost horizontally
from the north.... A divinity must
have stirred within them, before the crystals did
thus shoot and set: wheels of the storm chariots.
The same law that shapes the earth and the stars
shapes the snowflake. Call it rather snow star.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
As surely as the petals of a flower are numbered,
each of these countless snow stars comes whirling
to earth, pronouncing thus with emphasis the
number six, order,
&amp;kappa;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigma;&amp;mu;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf;.
This was the beginning
of a storm which reached far and wide, and
elsewhere was more severe than here. On the
Saskatchewan, where no man of science is present
to behold, still down they come, and not the less
fulfil their destiny, perchance melt at once on the
Indian&#8217;s face. What a world we live in, where
myriads of these little discs, so beautiful to the
most prying eye, are whirled down on every
traveller&#8217;s coat, the observant and the unobservant,
on the restless squirrel&#8217;s fur, on the far-stretching
fields and forests, the wooded dells and
the mountain tops. Far, far away from the haunts
of men, they roll down some little slope, fall over
and come to their bearings, and melt or lose their
beauty in the mass, ready anon to swell some little
rill with their contribution, and so, at last, the
universal ocean from which they came. There
they lie, like the wreck of chariot wheels after a
battle in the skies. Meanwhile the meadow mouse
shoves them aside in his gallery, the schoolboy
casts them in his ball, or the woodman&#8217;s sled
glides smoothly over them, these glorious
spangles, the sweepings of heaven&#8217;s floor. And
they all sing, melting as they sing, of the mysteries
of the number six; six, six, six. He takes up the
waters of the sea in his hand, leaving the salt; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
disperses it in mist through the skies; he re-collects
and sprinkles it like grain in six-rayed snowy
stars over the earth, there to lie till he dissolves
its bonds again.&#8221;</p>
<p>But here is a bit of snow which seems less pure,
with grayish patches here and there. Down again
to sparrow-level and bring the glass to bear.
Your farmer friend will tell you that they are
snow-fleas which are snowed down with the flakes;
the entomologist will call them <i>Achorutes nivicola</i>
and he knows that they have prosaically wiggled
their way from the crevices of bark on the nearest
tree-trunk. One&#8217;s thrill of pleasure at this unexpected
discovery will lead one to adopt sparrow-views
whenever larger game is lacking.</p>

<a name='CEDAR_BIRDS_AND_BERRIES' id='CEDAR_BIRDS_AND_BERRIES'></a>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
<h2>CEDAR BIRDS AND BERRIES</h2>
</div>

<p>Keep sharp eyes upon the cedar groves in
mid-winter, and sooner or later you will see
the waxwings come, not singly or in pairs, but by
dozens, and sometimes in great flocks. They will
well repay all the watching one gives them. The
cedar waxwing is a strange bird, with a very pronounced
species-individuality, totally unlike any
other bird of our country. When feeding on their
favourite winter berries, these birds show to great
advantage; the warm rich brown of the upper
parts and of the crest contrasting with the black,
scarlet, and yellow, and these, in turn, with the
dark green of the cedar and the white of the snow.</p>
<p>The name waxwing is due to the scarlet ornaments
at the tips of the lesser flight feathers and
some of the tail feathers, which resemble bits of
red sealing wax, but which are really the bare,
flattened ends of the feather shafts. Cherry-bird
is another name which is appropriately applied to
the cedar waxwing.</p>
<p>These birds are never regular in their movements,
and they come and go without heed to
weather or date. They should never be lightly
passed by, but their flocks carefully examined, lest
among their ranks may be hidden a Bohemian
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
chatterer&mdash;a stately waxwing larger than common
and even more beautiful in hue, whose large
size and splashes of white upon its wings will
always mark it out.</p>
<p>This bird is one of our rarest of rare visitors,
breeding in the far north; and even in its nest and
eggs mystery enshrouds it. Up to fifty years ago,
absolutely nothing was known of its nesting
habits, although during migration Bohemian chatterers
are common all over Europe. At last Lapland
was found to be their home, and a nest has
been found in Alaska and several others in Labrador.
My only sight of these birds was of a pair
perched in an elm tree in East Orange, New Jersey;
but I will never forget it, and will never
cease to hope for another such red-letter day.</p>
<p>The movements of the cedar waxwings are as
uncertain in summer as they are in winter; they
may be common in one locality for a year or two,
and then, apparently without reason, desert it. At
this season they feed on insects instead of berries,
and may be looked for in small flocks in orchard
or wood. The period of nesting is usually late,
and, in company with the goldfinches, they do not
begin their housekeeping until July and August.
Unlike other birds, waxwings will build their nests
of almost anything near at hand, and apparently
in any growth which takes their fancy,&mdash;apple,
oak, or cedar. The nests are well constructed,
however, and often, with their contents, add
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
another background of a most pleasing harmony
of colours. A nest composed entirely of pale
green hanging moss, with eggs of bluish gray,
spotted and splashed with brown and black,
guarded by a pair of these exquisite birds, is a
sight to delight the eye.</p>
<p>When the young have left the nest, if alarmed
by an intruder, they will frequently, trusting to
their protective dress of streaky brown, freeze
into most unbird-like attitudes, drawing the
feathers close to the body and stretching the neck
stiffly upward,&mdash;almost bittern-like. Undoubtedly
other interesting habits which these strangely
picturesque birds may possess are still awaiting
discovery by some enthusiastic observer with a
pair of opera-glasses and a stock of that ever
important characteristic&mdash;patience.</p>
<p>Although, during the summer months, myriads
of insects are killed and eaten by the cedar waxwings,
yet these birds are preeminently berry
eaters,&mdash;choke-cherries, cedar berries, blueberries,
and raspberries being preferred. Watch a
flock of these birds in a cherry tree, and you will
see the pits fairly rain down. We need not place
our heads, <i>à la</i> Newton, in the path of these falling
stones to deduce some interesting facts,&mdash;indeed
to solve the very destiny of the fruit. Many whole
cherries are carried away by the birds to be devoured
elsewhere, or we may see parent waxwing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
filling their gullets with ten or a dozen berries and
carrying them to the eager nestlings.</p>
<p>Thus is made plain the why and the wherefore
of the coloured skin, the edible flesh, and the hidden
stone of the fruit. The conspicuous racemes
of the choke-cherries, or the shining scarlet globes
of the cultivated fruit, fairly shout aloud to the
birds&mdash;&#8220;Come and eat us, we&#8217;re as good as we
look!&#8221; But Mother Nature looks on and laughs
to herself. Thistle seeds are blown to the land&#8217;s
end by the wind; the heavier ticks and burrs are
carried far and wide upon the furry coats of passing
creatures; but the cherry could not spread its
progeny beyond a branch&#8217;s length, were it not for
the ministrations of birds. With birds, as with
some other bipeds, the shortest way to the heart
is through the stomach, and a choke-cherry tree
in full blaze of fruit is always a natural aviary.
Where a cedar bird has built its nest, there look
some day to see a group of cherry trees; where
convenient fence-perches along the roadside lead
past cedar groves, there hope before long to see
a bird-planted avenue of cedars. And so the marvels
of Nature go on evolving,&mdash;wheels within
wheels.</p>

<h2>THE DARK DAYS OF INSECT LIFE</h2>
</div>

<p>Sometimes by too close and confining study
of things pertaining to the genus <i>Homo</i>, we
perchance find ourselves complacently wondering
if we have not solved almost all the problems of
this little whirling sphere of water and earth. Our
minds turn to the ultra questions of atoms and
ions and rays and our eyes strain restlessly upward
toward our nearest planet neighbour, in
half admission that we must soon take up the
study of Mars from sheer lack of earthly conquest.</p>
<p>If so minded, hie you to the nearest grove and,
digging down through the mid-winter&#8217;s snow,
bring home a spadeful of leaf-mould. Examine
it carefully with hand-lens and microscope, and
then prophesy what warmth and light will bring
forth. &#8220;Watch the unfolding life of plant and animal,
and then come from your planet-yearning
back to earth, with a humbleness born of a realisation
of our vast ignorance of the commonest things
about us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though the immediate mysteries of the seed and
the egg baffle us, yet the most casual lover of
God&#8217;s out-of-doors may hopefully attempt to solve
the question of some of the winter homes of
insects. Think of the thousands upon thousands
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
of eggs and pupæ which are hidden in every
grove; what catacombs of bug mummies yonder
log conceals,&mdash;mummies whose resurrection will
be brought about by the alchemy of thawing sunbeams.
Follow out the suggestion hinted at above
and place a handkerchief full of frozen mould or
decayed wood in a white dish, and the tiny universe
which will gradually unfold before you will
provide many hours of interest. But remember
your responsibilities in so doing, and do not let
the tiny plant germs languish and die for want
of water, or the feeble, newly-hatched insects
perish from cold or lack a bit of scraped meat.</p>
<p>Cocoons are another never-ending source of
delight. If you think that there are no unsolved
problems of the commonest insect life around us,
say why it is that the moths and millers pass the
winter wrapped in swaddling clothes of densest
textures, roll upon roll of silken coverlets; while
our delicate butterflies hang uncovered, suspended
only by a single loop of silk, exposed to the cold
blast of every northern gale? Why do the caterpillars
of our giant moths&mdash;the mythologically
named Cecropia, Polyphemus, Luna, and Prometheus&mdash;show
such individuality in the position
which they choose for their temporary shrouds?
Protection and concealment are the watchwords
held to in each case, but how differently they are

<p>Cecropia&mdash;that beauty whose wings, fully six
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
inches across, will flap gracefully through the
summer twilight&mdash;weaves about himself a half
oval mound, along some stem or tree-trunk, and
becomes a mere excrescence&mdash;the veriest unedible
thing a bird may spy. Polyphemus wraps
miles of finest silk about his green worm-form
(how, even though we watch him do it, we can only
guess); weaving in all the surrounding leaves he
can reach. This, of course, before the frosts come,
but when the leaves at last shrivel, loosen, and
their petioles break, it is merely a larger brown
nut than usual that falls to the ground, the kernel
of which will sprout next June and blossom into
the big moth of delicate fawn tints, feathery
horned, with those strange isinglass windows in
his hind wings.</p>
<p>Luna&mdash;the weird, beautiful moon-moth, whose
pale green hues and long graceful streamers make
us realise how much beauty we miss if we neglect
the night life of summer&mdash;when clad in her
temporary shroud of silk, sometimes falls to the
ground, or again the cocoon remains in the tree
or bush where it was spun.</p>
<p>But Prometheus, the smallest of the quartet,
has a way all his own. The elongated cocoon,
looking like a silken finger, is woven about a leaf
of sassafras. Even the long stem of the leaf is
silk-girdled, and a strong band is looped about the
twig to which the leaf is attached. Here, when
all the leaves fall, he hangs, the plaything of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
every breeze, attracting the attention of all the
hungry birds. But little does Prometheus care.
Sparrows may hover about him and peck in vain;
chickadees may clutch the dangling finger and
pound with all their tiny might. Prometheus is
&#8220;bound,&#8221; indeed, and merely swings the faster,
up and down, from side to side.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that when two Prometheus
cocoons, fastened upon their twigs, were
suspended in a large cageful of native birds, it
took a healthy chickadee just three days of hard
pounding and unravelling to force a way through
the silken envelopes to the chrysalids within.
Such long continued and persistent labour for so
comparatively small a morsel of food would not
be profitable or even possible out-of-doors in winter.
The bird would starve to death while forcing
its way through the protecting silk.</p>
<p>These are only four of the many hundreds of
cocoons, from the silken shrouds on the topmost
branches to the jugnecked chrysalis of a sphinx
moth&mdash;offering us the riddle of a winter&#8217;s shelter
buried in the cold, dark earth.</p>
<p>Is everything frozen tight? Has Nature&#8217;s frost
mortar cemented every stone in its bed? Then
cut off the solid cups of the pitcher plants, and
see what insects formed the last meal of these
strange growths,&mdash;ants, flies, bugs, encased in
ice like the fossil insects caught in the amber sap
which flowed so many thousands of years ago.

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
<h2>CHAMELEONS IN FUR AND FEATHER</h2>
</div>

<p>The colour of things in nature has been the
subject of many volumes and yet it may be
truthfully said that no two naturalists are wholly
agreed on the interpretation of the countless hues
of plants and animals. Some assert that all alleged
instances of protective colouring and mimicry are
merely the result of accident; while at the opposite
swing of the pendulum we find theories, protective
and mimetic, for the colours of even the
tiny one-celled green plants which cover the bark
of trees! Here is abundant opportunity for any
observer of living nature to help toward the solution
of these problems.</p>
<p>In a battle there are always two sides and at its
finish one side always runs away while the other
pursues. Thus it is in the wars of nature, only
here the timid ones are always ready to flee, while
the strong are equally prepared to pursue. It is
only by constant vigilance that the little mice can
save themselves from disappearing down the
throats of their enemies, as under cover of darkness
they snatch nervous mouthfuls of grain in
the fields,&mdash;and hence their gray colour and their
large, watchful eyes; but on the other hand, the
baby owls in their hollow tree would starve if the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
parents were never able to swoop down in the
darkness and surprise a mouse now and then,&mdash;hence
the gray plumage and great eyes of the
parent owls.</p>
<p>The most convincing proof of the reality of protective
coloration is in the change of plumage or
fur of some of the wild creatures to suit the season.
In the far north, the grouse or ptarmigan,
as they are called, do not keep feathers of the
same colour the year round, as does our ruffed
grouse; but change their dress no fewer than three
times. When rocks and moss are buried deep
beneath the snow, and a keen-eyed hawk appears,
the white-feathered ptarmigan crouches and becomes
an inanimate mound. Later in the year,
with the increasing warmth, patches of gray and
brown earth appear, and simultaneously, as if its
feathers were really snowflakes, splashes of brown
replace the pure white of the bird&#8217;s plumage, and
equally baffle the eye. Seeing one of these birds
by itself, we could readily tell, from the colour of
its plumage, the time of year and general aspect
of the country from which it came. Its plumage
is like a mirror which reflects the snow, the moss,
or the lichens in turn. It is, indeed, a feathered
chameleon, but with changes of colour taking place
more slowly than is the case in the reptile.</p>
<p>We may discover changes somewhat similar,
but furry instead of feathery, in the woods about
our home. The fiercest of all the animals of our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
continent still evades the exterminating inroads
of man; indeed it often puts his traps to shame,
and wages destructive warfare in his very midst.
I speak of the weasel,&mdash;the least of all his family,
and yet, for his size, the most bloodthirsty and
widely dreaded little demon of all the countryside.
His is a name to conjure with among all the
lesser wood-folk; the scent of his passing brings
an almost helpless paralysis. And yet in some
way he must be handicapped, for his slightly
larger cousin, the mink, finds good hunting the
year round, clad in a suit of rich brown; while the
weasel, at the approach of winter, sheds his summer
dress of chocolate hue and dons a pure white
fur, a change which would seem to put the poor
mice and rabbits at a hopeless disadvantage.
Nevertheless the ermine, as he is now called
(although wrongly so), seems just able to hold his
own, with all his evil slinking motions and bloodthirsty
desires; for foxes, owls, and hawks take,
in their turn, heavy toll. Nature is ever a repetition
of the &#8220;House that Jack built&#8221;;&mdash;this is
the owl that ate the weasel that killed the mouse,
and so on.</p>
<p>The little tail-tips of milady&#8217;s ermine coat are
black; and herein lies an interesting fact in the
coloration of the weasel and one that, perhaps,
gives a clue to some other hitherto inexplicable
spots and markings on the fur, feathers, skin, and
scales of wild creatures. Whatever the season,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
and whatever the colour of the weasel&#8217;s coat,&mdash;brown
or white,&mdash;the tip of the tail remains
always black. This would seem, at first thought,
a very bad thing for the little animal. Knowing
so little of fear, he never tucks his tail between
his legs, and, when shooting across an open
expanse of snow, the black tip ever trailing after
him would seem to mark him out for destruction
by every observing hawk or fox.</p>
<p>But the very opposite is the case as Mr. Witmer
Stone so well relates. &#8220;If you place a weasel in
its winter white on new-fallen snow, in such a
position that it casts no shadow, you will find that
the black tip of the tail catches your eye and holds
it in spite of yourself, so that at a little distance
it is very difficult to follow the outline of the rest
of the animal. Cover the tip of the tail with snow
and you can see the rest of the weasel itself
much more clearly; but as long as the black
point is in sight, you see that, and that only.</p>
<p>&#8220;If a hawk or owl, or any other of the larger
hunters of the woodland, were to give chase to a
weasel and endeavour to pounce upon it, it would
in all probability be the black tip of the tail it
would see and strike at, while the weasel, darting
ahead, would escape. It may, morever, serve as
a guide, enabling the young weasels to follow their
parents more readily through grass and brambles.</p>
<p>&#8220;One would suppose that this beautiful white
fur of winter, literally as white as the snow, might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
prove a disadvantage at times by making its owner
conspicuous when the ground is bare in winter,
as it frequently is even in the North; yet though
weasels are about more or less by day, you will
seldom catch so much as a glimpse of one at such
times, though you may hear their sharp chirrup
close at hand. Though bold and fearless, they
have the power of vanishing instantly, and the
slightest alarm sends them to cover. I have seen
one standing within reach of my hand in the sunshine
on the exposed root of a tree, and while I
was staring at it, it vanished like the flame of a
candle blown out, without leaving me the slightest
clue as to the direction it had taken. All the
weasels I have ever seen, either in the woods or
open meadows, disappeared in a similar manner.&#8221;</p>
<p>To add to the completeness of proof that the
change from brown to white is for protection,&mdash;in
the case of the weasel, both to enable it to
escape from the fox and to circumvent the rabbit,&mdash;the
weasels in Florida, where snow is unknown,
do not change colour, but remain brown throughout
the whole year.</p>

<h2>FEBRUARY FEATHERS</h2>
</div>

<p>February holes are most interesting places
and one never knows what will be found in
the next one investigated. It is a good plan, in
one&#8217;s walks in the early fall, to make a mental
map of all the auspicious looking trees and holes,
and then go the rounds of these in winter&mdash;as a
hunter follows his line of traps. An old, neglected
orchard may seem perfectly barren of life;
insects dead, leaves fallen, and sap frozen; but
the warm hearts of these venerable trees may
shelter much beside the larvæ of boring beetles,
and we may reap a winter harvest of which the
farmer knows nothing.</p>
<p>Poke a stick into a knothole and stir up the
leaves at the bottom of the cavity, and then look
in. Two great yellow eyes may greet you, glaring
intermittently, and sharp clicks may assail your
ears. Reach in with your gloved hand and bring
the screech owl out. He will blink in the sunshine,
ruffling up his feathers until he is twice his
real size. The light partly blinds him, but toss
him into the air and he will fly without difficulty
and select with ease a secluded perch. The instant
he alights a wonderful transformation comes over
him. He stiffens, draws himself as high as possible,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
and compresses his feathers until he seems
naught but the slender, broken stump of
some bough,&mdash;ragged topped (thanks to his
&#8220;horns&#8221;), gray and lichened. It is little short
of a miracle how this spluttering, saucer-eyed,
feathered cat can melt away into woody fibre
before our very eyes.</p>
<p>We quickly understand why in the daytime the
little owl is so anxious to hide his form from public
view. Although he can see well enough to fly
and to perch, yet the bright sunlight on the snow
is too dazzling to permit of swift and sure action.
All the birds of the winter woods seem to know
this and instantly take advantage of it. Sparrows,
chickadees, and woodpeckers go nearly wild
with excitement when they discover the little owl,
hovering about him and occasionally making darts
almost in his very face. We can well believe that
as the sun sets, after an afternoon of such excitement,
they flee in terror, selecting for that night&#8217;s
perch the densest tangle of sweetbrier to be found.</p>
<p>One hollow tree may yield a little gray owl,
while from the next we may draw a red one; and
the odd thing about this is that this difference in
colour does not depend upon age, sex, or season,
and no ornithologist can say why it occurs. What
can these little fellows find to feed upon these cold
nights, when the birds seek the most hidden and
sheltered retreats? We might murder the next
owl we come across; but would any fact we might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
discover in his poor stomach repay us for the
thought of having needlessly cut short his life,
with its pleasures and spring courtships, and the
delight he will take in the half a dozen pearls over
which he will soon watch?</p>
<p>A much better way is to examine the ground
around his favourite roosting place, where we will
find many pellets of fur and bones, with now and
then a tiny skull. These tell the tale, and if at
dusk we watch closely, we may see the screech owl
look out of his door, stretch every limb, purr his
shivering song, and silently launch out over the
fields, a feathery, shadowy death to all small mice
who scamper too far from their snow tunnels.</p>
<p>When you feel like making a new and charming
acquaintance, take your way to a dense clump of
snow-laden cedars, and look carefully over their
trunks. If you are lucky you will spy a tiny gray
form huddled close to the sheltered side of the
bark, and if you are careful you may approach and
catch in your hand the smallest of all our owls,
for the saw-whet is a dreadfully sleepy fellow in
the daytime. I knew of eleven of these little gray
gnomes dozing in a clump of five small cedars.</p>
<p>The cedars are treasure-houses in winter, and
many birds find shelter among the thick foliage,
and feast upon the plentiful supply of berries,
when elsewhere there seems little that could keep
a bird&#8217;s life in its body. When the tinkling of
breaking icicles is taken up by the wind and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
re-echoed from the tops of the cedars, you may
know that a flock of purple finches is near, and so
greedy and busy are they that you may approach
within a few feet. These birds are unfortunately
named, as there is nothing purple about their
plumage. The males are a delicate rose-red, while
the females look like commonplace sparrows,
streaked all over with black and brown.</p>
<p>There are other winter birds, whose home is in
the North, with a similar type of coloration.
Among the pines you may see a flock of birds, as
large as a sparrow, with strange-looking beaks.
The tips of the two mandibles are long, curved,
and pointed, crossing each other at their ends.
This looks like a deformity, but is in reality a
splendid cone-opener and seed-extracter. These
birds are the crossbills.</p>
<p>Even in the cold of a February day, we may,
on very rare occasions, be fortunate enough to
hear unexpected sounds, such as the rattle of a
belted kingfisher, or the croak of a night heron;
for these birds linger until every bit of pond or
lake is sealed with ice; and when a thaw comes, a
lonely bat may surprise us with a short flight
through the frosty air, before it returns to its
winter&#8217;s trance.</p>
<p>Of course, in the vicinity of our towns and cities,
the most noticeable birds at this season of the
year (as indeed at all seasons) are the English
sparrows and (at least near New York City) the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
starlings, those two foreigners which have
wrought such havoc among our native birds.
Their mingled flocks fly up, not only from garbage
piles and gutters, but from the thickets and fields
which should be filled with our sweet-voiced
American birds. It is no small matter for man
heedlessly to interfere with Nature. What may
be a harmless, or even useful, bird in its native
land may prove a terrible scourge when introduced
where there are no enemies to keep it in
check. Nature is doing her best to even matters
by letting albinism run riot among the sparrows,
and best of all by teaching sparrow hawks to nest
under our eaves and thus be on equal terms with
their sparrow prey. The starlings are turning
out to be worse than the sparrows. Already they
are invading the haunts of our grackles and redwings.</p>
<p>On some cold day, when the sun is shining, visit
all the orchards of which you know, and see if in
one or more you cannot find a good-sized, gray,
black, and white bird, which keeps to the topmost
branch of a certain tree. Look at him carefully
through your glasses, and if his beak is hooked,
like that of a hawk, you may know that you are
watching a northern shrike, or butcher bird. His
manner is that of a hawk, and his appearance
causes instant panic among small birds. If you
watch long enough you may see him pursue and
kill a goldfinch, or sparrow, and devour it. These
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
birds are not even distantly related to the hawks,
but have added a hawk&#8217;s characteristics and appetite
to the insect diet of their nearest relations.
If ever shrikes will learn to confine their attacks
to English sparrows, we should offer them every
encouragement.</p>
<p>All winter long the ebony forms of crows vibrate
back and forth across the cold sky. If we watch
them when very high up, we sometimes see them
sail a short distance, and without fail, a second
later, the clear &#8220;<i>Caw! caw!</i>&#8221; comes down to us,
the sound-waves unable to keep pace with those
of light, as the thunder of the storm lags behind
the flash. These sturdy birds seem able to stand
any severity of the weather, but, like Achilles, they
have one vulnerable point, the eyes,&mdash;which, during
the long winter nights, must be kept deep
buried among the warm feathers.</p>

<a name='FISH_LIFE' id='FISH_LIFE'></a>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
<h2>FISH LIFE</h2>
</div>

<p>We have all looked down through the clear
water of brook or pond and watched the
gracefully poised trout or pickerel; but have we
ever tried to imagine what the life of one of these
aquatic beings is really like? &#8220;Water Babies&#8221;
perhaps gives us the best idea of existence below
the water, but if we spend one day each month
for a year in trying to imagine ourselves in the
place of the fish, we will see that a fish-eye view
of life holds much of interest.</p>
<p>What a delightful sensation must it be to all
but escape the eternal downpull of gravity, to
float and turn and rise and fall at will, and all by
the least twitch of tail or limb,&mdash;for fish have
limbs, four of them, as truly as has a dog or horse,
only instead of fingers or toes there are many delicate
rays extending through the fin. These four
limb-fins are useful chiefly as balancers, while the
tail-fin is what sends the fish darting through the
water, or turns it to right or left, with incredible
swiftness.</p>
<p>If we were able to examine some inhabitant of
the planet Mars our first interest would be to
know with what senses they were endowed, and
these finny creatures living in their denser medium,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
which after a few seconds would mean death
to us, excite the same interest. They see, of
course, having eyes, but do they feel, hear, and
smell!</p>
<p>Probably the sense of taste is least developed.
When a trout leaps at and catches a fly he does
not stop to taste, otherwise the pheasant feather
concealing the cruel hook would be of little use.
When an animal catches its food in the water and
swallows it whole, taste plays but a small part.
Thus the tongue of a pelican is a tiny flap all but
lost to view in its great bill.</p>
<p>Water is an excellent medium for carrying minute
particles of matter and so the sense of smell
is well developed. A bit of meat dropped into the
sea will draw the fish from far and wide, and a
slice of liver will sometimes bring a score
of sharks and throw them into the greatest
excitement.</p>
<p>Fishes are probably very near-sighted, but that
they can distinguish details is apparent in the
choice which a trout exhibits in taking certain
coloured artificial flies. We may suppose from
what we know of physics that when we lean over
and look down into a pool, the fishy eyes which
peer up at us discern only a dark, irregular mass.
I have seen a pickerel dodge as quickly at a sudden
cloud-shadow as at the motion of a man wielding
a fish pole.</p>
<p>We can be less certain about the hearing of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
fishes. They have, however, very respectable
inner ears, built on much the same plan as in
higher animals. Indeed many fish, such as the
grunts, make various sounds which are plainly
audible even to our ears high above the water, and
we cannot suppose that this is a useless accomplishment.
But the ears of fishes and the line of
tiny tubes which extends along the side may be
more effective in recording the tremors of the
water transmitted by moving objects than actual
sound.</p>
<p>Watch a lazy catfish winding its way along near
the bottom, with its barbels extended, and you
will at once realise that fishes can feel, this function
being very useful to those kinds which search
for their food in the mud at the bottom.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Not a breath of air stirs the surface of the woodland
pond, and the trees about the margin are
reflected unbroken in its surface. The lilies and
their pads lie motionless, and in and out through
the shadowy depths, around the long stems, float
a school of half a dozen little sunfish. They move
slowly, turning from side to side all at once as
if impelled by one idea. Now and then one will
dart aside and snap up a beetle or mosquito larva,
then swing back to its place among its fellows.
Their beautiful scales flash scarlet, blue, and gold,
and their little hand-and-foot fins are ever trembling
and waving. They drift upward nearer the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
surface, the wide round eyes turning and twisting
in their sockets, ever watchful for food and
danger. Without warning a terrific splash scatters
them, and when the ripples and bubbles cease,
five frightened sunfish cringe in terror among the
water plants of the bottom mud. Off to her nest
goes the kingfisher, bearing to her brood the
struggling sixth.</p>
<p>Later in the day, when danger seemed far off,
a double-pointed vise shot toward the little group
of &#8220;pumpkin seeds&#8221; and a great blue heron swallowed
one of their number. Another, venturing
too far beyond the protection of the lily stems and
grass tangle of the shallows, fell victim to a voracious
pickerel. But the most terrible fate befell
when one day a black sinuous body came swiftly
through the water. The fish had never seen its
like before and yet some instinct told them that
here was death indeed and they fled as fast as
their fins could send them. The young otter had
marked the trio and after it he sped, turning,
twisting, following every movement with never a
stop for breath until he had caught his prey.</p>
<p>But the life of a fish is not all tragedy, and the
two remaining sunfish may live in peace. In
spawning time they clear a little space close to
the water of the inlet, pulling up the young weeds
and pushing up the sandy bottom until a hollow,
bowl-like nest is prepared. Thoreau tells us that
here the fish &#8220;may be seen early in summer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
assiduously brooding, and driving away minnows
and larger fishes, even its own species, which
would disturb its ova, pursuing them a few feet,
and circling round swiftly to its nest again; the
minnows, like young sharks, instantly entering the
empty nests, meanwhile, and swallowing the
spawn, which is attached to the weeds and to the
bottom, on the sunny side. The spawn is exposed
to so many dangers that a very small proportion
can ever become fishes, for beside being the constant
prey of birds and fishes, a great many nests
are made so near the shore, in shallow water, that
they are left dry in a few days, as the river goes
down. These and the lampreys are the only fishes&#8217;
nests that I have observed, though the ova of some
species may be seen floating on the surface. The
sunfish are so careful of their charge that you may
stand close by in the water and examine them at
your leisure. I have thus stood over them half
an hour at a time, and stroked them familiarly
without frightening them, suffering them to nibble
my fingers harmlessly, and seen them erect their
dorsal fins in anger when my hand approached
their ova, and have even taken them gently out
of the water with my hand; though this cannot be
accomplished by a sudden movement, however
dexterous, for instant warning is conveyed to
them through their denser element, but only by
letting the fingers gradually close about them as
they are poised over the palm, and with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
utmost gentleness raising them slowly to the surface.
Though stationary, they kept up a constant
sculling or waving motion with their fins, which is
exceedingly graceful, and expressive of their
humble happiness; for unlike ours, the element in
which they live is a stream which must be constantly
resisted. From time to time they nibble
the weeds at the bottom or overhanging their
nests, or dart after a fly or worm. The dorsal
fin, besides answering the purpose of a keel, with
the anal, serves to keep the fish upright, for in
shallow water, where this is not covered, they fall
on their sides. As you stand thus stooping over
the sunfish in its nest, the edges of the dorsal and
caudal fins have a singular dusty golden reflection,
and its eyes, which stand out from the head,
are transparent and colourless. Seen in its native
element, it is a very beautiful and compact fish,
perfect in all its parts, and looks like a brilliant
coin fresh from the mint. It is a perfect jewel of
the river, the green, red, coppery, and golden
reflections of its mottled sides being the concentration
of such rays as struggle through the floating
pads and flowers to the sandy bottom, and in
harmony with the sunlit brown and yellow
pebbles.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the cold days of winter come and the ice
begins to close over the pond, the sunfish become
sluggish and keep near the bottom, half-hibernating
but not unwilling to snap at any bit of food
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
which may drift near them. Lying prone on the
ice we may see them poising with slowly undulating
fins, waiting, in their strange wide-eyed sleep,
for the warmth which will bring food and active
life again.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
<h2>TENANTS OF WINTER BIRDS&#8217; NESTS</h2>
</div>

<p>When we realise how our lives are hedged
about by butchers, bakers, and luxury-makers,
we often envy the wild creatures their independence.
And yet, although each animal is
capable of finding its own food and shelter and of
avoiding all ordinary danger, there is much dependence,
one upon another, among the little
creatures of fur and feathers.</p>
<p>The first instinct of a gray squirrel, at the
approach of winter, is to seek out a deep, warm,
hollow limb, or trunk. Nowadays, however, these
are not to be found in every grove. The precepts
of modern forestry decree that all such unsightly
places must be filled with cement and creosote and
well sealed against the entrance of rain and snow.
When hollows are not available, these hardy squirrels
prepare their winter home in another way.
Before the leaves have begun to loosen on their
stalks, the little creatures set to work. The crows
have long since deserted their rough nest of sticks
in the top of some tall tree, and now the squirrels
come, investigate, and adopt the forsaken bird&#8217;s-nest
as the foundation of their home. The sticks
are pressed more tightly together, all interstices
filled up, and then a superstructure of leafy twigs
is woven overhead and all around. The leaves on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
these twigs, killed before their time, do not fall;
and when the branches of the tree become bare,
there remains in one of the uppermost crotches a
big ball of leaves,&mdash;rain and snow proof, with a
tiny entrance at one side.</p>
<p>On a stormy mid-winter afternoon we stand
beneath the tree and, through the snowflakes
driven past by the howling gale, we catch glimpses
of the nest swaying high in air. Far over it
leans, as the branches are whipped and bent by
the wind, and yet so cunningly is it wrought that
never a twig or leaf loosens. We can imagine the
pair of little shadow-tails within, sleeping fearlessly
throughout all the coming night.</p>
<p>But the sleep of the gray squirrel is a healthy
and a natural one, not the half-dead trance of
hibernation; and early next morning their sharp
eyes appear at the entrance of their home and
they are out and off through the tree-top path
which only their feet can traverse. Down the
snowy trunks they come with a rush, and with
strong, clean bounds they head unerringly for
their little <i>caches</i> of nuts. Their provender is
hidden away among the dried leaves, and when
they want a nibble of nut or acorn they make their
way, by some mysterious sense, even through
three feet of snow, down to the bit of food which,
months before, they patted out of sight among the
moss and leaves.</p>
<p>It would seem that some exact sub-conscious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
sense of locality would be a more probable solution
of this feat than the sense of smell, however
keenly developed, when we consider that dozens
of nuts may be hidden or buried in close proximity
to the one sought by the squirrel.</p>
<p>Even though the birds seem to have vanished
from the earth, and every mammal be deeply
buried in its long sleep, no winter&#8217;s walk need be
barren of interest. A suggestion worth trying
would be to choose a certain area of saplings and
underbrush and proceed systematically to fathom
every cause which has prevented the few stray
leaves still upon their stalks from falling with
their many brethren now buried beneath the snow.</p>
<p>The encircling silken bonds of Promethea and
Cynthia cocoons will account for some; others will
puzzle us until we have found the traces of some
insect foe, whose girdling has killed the twig and
thus prevented the leaf from falling at the usual
time; some may be simply mechanical causes,
where a broken twig crotch has fallen athwart
another stem in the course of its downward fall.
Then there is the pitiful remnant of a last summer&#8217;s
bird&#8217;s-nest, with a mere skeleton of a floor
all but disintegrated.</p>
<p>But occasionally a substantial ball of dead
leaves will be noticed, swung amid a tangle of
brier. No accident lodged these, nor did any
insect have aught to do with their position.
Examine carefully the mass of leaves and you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
will find a replica of the gray squirrel&#8217;s nest, only,
of course, much smaller. This handiwork of the
white-footed or deer mouse can be found in almost
every field or tangle of undergrowth; the nest of
a field sparrow or catbird being used as a foundation
and thickly covered over and tightly thatched
with leaves. Now and then, even in mid-winter,
we may find the owner at home, and as the weasel
is the most bloodthirsty, so the deer mouse is the
most beautiful and gentle of all the fur-coated folk
of our woods. With his coat of white and pale
golden brown and his great black, lustrous eyes,
and his timid, trusting ways, he is altogether
lovable.</p>
<p>He spends the late summer and early autumn
in his tangle-hung home, but in winter he generally
selects a snug hollow log, or some cavity
in the earth. Here he makes a round nest of fine
grass and upon a couch of thistledown he sleeps
in peace, now and then waking to partake of the
little hoard of nuts which he has gathered, or he
may even dare to frolic about upon the snow in
the cold winter moonlight, leaving behind him no
trace, save the fairy tracery of his tiny footprints.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
<h2>WINTER HOLES</h2>
</div>

<p>The decayed hollows which we have mentioned
as so often productive of little owls
have their possibilities by no means exhausted by
one visit. The disturbed owl may take himself
elsewhere, after being so unceremoniously disturbed;
but there are roving, tramp-like characters,
with dispositions taking them here and there
through the winter nights, to whom, at break of
day, a hole is ever a sought-for haven.</p>
<p>So do not put your hand too recklessly into an
owl hole, for a hiss and a sudden nip may show
that an opossum has taken up his quarters there.
If you must, pull him out by his squirming, naked
tail, but do not carry him home, as he makes a
poor pet, and between hen-house traps and irate
farmers, he has good reason, in this part of the
country at least, to be short tempered.</p>
<p>Of course the birds&#8217;-nests are all deserted now,
but do not be too sure of the woodpeckers&#8217; holes.
The little downy and his larger cousin, the hairy
woodpecker, often spend the winter nights snug
within deep cavities which they have hollowed out,
each bird for itself. I have never known a pair
to share one of these shelters.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in pulling off the loose bark from a
decayed stump, several dry, flattened scales will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
fall out upon the snow among the debris of wood
and dead leaves. Hold them close in the warm
palm of your hand for a time and the dried bits
will quiver, the sides partly separate, and behold!
you have brought back to life a beautiful
<i>Euvanessa</i>, or mourning-cloak butterfly. Lay it
upon the snow and soon the awakened life will
ebb away and it will again be stiff, as in death. If
you wish, take it home, and you may warm it into
activity, feed it upon a drop of syrup and freeze
it again at will. Sometimes six or eight of these
insects may be found sheltered under the bark of
a single stump, or in a hollow beneath a stone.
Several species share this habit of hibernating
throughout the winter.</p>
<p>Look carefully in old, deserted sheds, in half-sheltered
hollows of trees, or in deep crevice-caverns
in rocks, and you may some day spy one
of the strangest of our wood-folk. A poor little
shrivelled bundle of fur, tight-clasped in its own
skinny fingers, with no more appearance of life
in its frozen body than if it were a mummy from
an Egyptian tomb; such is the figure that will
meet your eye when you chance upon a bat in the
deep trance of its winter&#8217;s hibernation. Often
you will find six or a dozen of these stiffened
forms clinging close together, head downward.</p>
<p>As in the case of the sleeping butterfly, carry
one of the bats to your warm room and place him
in a bird-cage, hanging him up on the top wires
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
by his toes, with his head downward. The inverted
position of these strange little beings always
brings to mind some of the experiences of Gulliver,
and indeed the life of a bat is more wonderful
than any fairy tale.</p>
<p>Probably the knowledge of bats which most of
us possess is chiefly derived from the imaginations
of artists and poets, who, unlike the Chinese,
do not look upon these creatures with much
favour, generally symbolising them in connection
with passages and pictures which relate to the
infernal regions. All of which is entirely unjust.
Their nocturnal habits and our consequent ignorance
of their characteristics are the only causes
which can account for their being associated with
the realm of Satan. In some places bats are called
flittermice, but they are more nearly related to
moles, shrews, and other insect-eaters than they
are to mice. If we look at the skeleton of an animal
which walks or hops we will notice that its
hind limbs are much the stronger, and that the
girdle which connects these with the backbone is
composed of strong and heavy bones. In bats a
reverse condition is found; the breast girdle, or
bones corresponding to our collar bones and
shoulder blades, are greatly developed. This, as
in birds, is, of course, an adaptation to give surface
for the attachment of the great propelling
muscles of the wings.</p>
<p>Although the hand of a bat is so strangely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
altered, yet, as we shall see if we look at our captive
specimen, it has five fingers, as we have, four
of which are very long and thin, and the webs, of
which we have a very noticeable trace in our own
hands, stretch from finger-tip to finger-tip, and to
the body and even down each leg, ending squarely
near the ankle, thus giving the creature the absurd
appearance of having on a very broad, baggy pair
of trousers.</p>
<p>When thoroughly warmed up, our bat will soon
start on a tour of inspection of his cage. He steps
rapidly from one wire to another, sometimes hooking
on with all five toes, but generally with four
or three. There seems to be little power in these
toes, except of remaining bent in a hooked position;
for when our bat stops and draws up one
foot to scratch the head, the claws are merely
jerked through the fur by motions of the whole
leg, not by individual movements of the separate
toes. In this motion we notice, for the first time,
that the legs and feet grow in a kind of &#8220;spread
eagle&#8221; position, making the knees point backward,
in the same direction as the elbows.</p>
<p>We must stop a moment to admire the beautiful
soft fur, a golden brown in colour, with part of
the back nearly black. The tiny inverted face is
full of expression, the bead-like eyes gleaming
brightly from out of their furry bed. The small
moist nostrils are constantly wrinkling and sniffling,
and the large size of the alert ears shows
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
how much their owner depends upon them for
information. If we suddenly move up closer to
the wires, the bat opens both wings owl-like, in a
most threatening manner; but if we make still
more hostile motions the creature retreats as
hastily as it can, changing its method of progress
to an all-fours, sloth-like gait, the long free thumb
of each hand grasping wire after wire and doing
most of the leverage, the hind legs following
passively.</p>
<p>When at what he judges a safe distance he again
hangs pendent, bending his head back to look
earnestly at us. Soon the half-opened wings are
closed and brought close to the shoulders, and in
this, the usual resting position, the large claws of
the thumbs rest on the breast in little furrows
which they have worn in the fur.</p>
<p>Soon drowsiness comes on and a long elaborate
yawn is given, showing the many small needle-like
teeth and the broad red tongue, which curls
outward to a surprising length. Then comes the
most curious process of all. Drawing up one leg,
the little creature deliberately wraps one hand
with its clinging web around the leg and under
the arms, and then draws the other wing straight
across the body, holds it there a moment, while it
takes a last look in all directions. Then lifting its
fingers slightly, it bends its head and wraps all in
the full-spread web. It is most ludicrously like a
tragedian, acting the death scene in &#8220;Julius
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
Cæsar,&#8221; and it loses nothing in repetition; for
each time the little animal thus draws its winding
sheet about its body, one is forced to smile as he
thinks of the absurd resemblance.</p>
<p>But all this and much more you will see for
yourself, if you are so fortunate as to discover the
hiding-place of the hibernating bat.</p>
<p>Our little brown bat is a most excellent mother,
and when in summer she starts out on her nocturnal
hunts she takes her tiny baby bat with
her. The weird little creature wraps his long
fingers about his mother&#8217;s neck and off they go.
When two young are born, the father bat is said
sometimes to assume entire control of one.</p>
<p>After we come to know more of the admirable
family traits of the <i>fledermaus</i>&mdash;its musical
German name&mdash;we shall willingly defend it from
the calumny which for thousands of years has been
heaped upon it.</p>
<p>Hibernation is a strange phenomenon, and one
which is but little understood. If we break into
the death-like trance for too long a time, or if we
do not supply the right kind of food, our captive
butterflies and bats will perish. So let us soon
freeze them up again and place them back in the
care of old Nature. Thus the pleasure is ours of
having made them yield up their secrets, without
any harm to them. Let us fancy that in the spring
they may remember us only as a strange dream
which has come to them during their long sleep.</p>

<h2>FEATHERED PIONEERS</h2>
</div>

<p>In the annual war of the seasons, March is the
time of the most bitterly contested battles.
But we&mdash;and very likely the birds&mdash;can look ahead
and realise what the final outcome will invariably
be, and, our sympathies being on the winning side,
every advance of spring&#8217;s outposts gladdens our
hearts. But winter is a stubborn foe, and sometimes
his snow and icicle battalions will not give
way a foot. Though by day the sun&#8217;s fierce
attack may drench the earth with the watery
blood of the ice legions, yet at night, silently
and grimly, new reserves of cold repair the
damage.</p>
<p>Our winter visitors are still in force. Amid the
stinging cold the wee brown form of a winter wren
will dodge round a brush pile&mdash;a tiny bundle of
energy which defies all chill winds and which
resolves bug chrysalides and frozen insects into
a marvellous activity. Other little birds, as small
as the wren, call to us from the pines and cedars&mdash;golden-crowned
kinglets, olive-green of body,
while on their heads burns a crest of orange and
gold.</p>
<p>When a good-sized brown bird flies up before
you, showing a flash of white on his rump, you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
may know him for the flicker, the most unwoodpecker-like
of his family. He is more or less
deserting the tree-climbing method for ground
feeding, and if you watch him you will see many
habits which his new mode of life is teaching him.</p>
<p>Even in the most wintry of Marches some warm,
thawing days are sure to be thrown in between
storms, and nothing, not even pussy willows and
the skunk cabbage, yield more quickly to the mellowing
influence than do the birds&mdash;sympathetic
brethren of ours that they are. Hardly has the
sunniest icicle begun to drop tears, when a song
sparrow flits to the top of a bush, clears his throat
with sharp chirps and shouts as loud as he can:
&#8220;Hip! Hip! Hip! Hurrah&mdash;!&#8221; Even more boreal
visitors feel the new influence, and tree and fox
sparrows warble sweetly. But the bluebird&#8217;s note
will always be spring&#8217;s dearest herald. When this
soft, mellow sound floats from the nearest fence
post, it seems to thaw something out of our ears;
from this instant winter seems on the defensive;
the crisis has come and gone in an instant, in a
single vibration of the air.</p>
<p>Bright colours are still scarce among our birds,
but another blue form may occasionally pass us,
for blue jays are more noticeable now than at any
other time of the year. Although not by any
means a rare bird, with us jays are shy and wary.
In Florida their southern cousins are as familiar
as robins, without a trace of fear of mankind.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
What curious notes our blue jays have&mdash;a creaking,
wheedling, rasping medley of sounds coming
through the leafless branches. At this time of
year they love acorns and nuts, but in the spring
&#8220;their fancy turns to thoughts of&#8221; eggs and young
nestlings, and they are accordingly hated by the
small birds. Nevertheless no bird is quicker to
shout and scream &#8220;Thief! Robber!&#8221; at some
harmless little owl than are these blue and white
rascals.</p>
<p>You may seek in vain to discover the first sign
of nesting among the birds. Scarcely has winter
set in in earnest, you will think, when the tiger-eyed
one of the woods&mdash;the great horned owl&mdash;will
have drifted up to some old hawk&#8217;s nest, and
laid her white spheres fairly in the snow. When
you discover her &#8220;horns&#8221; above the nest lining of
dried leaves, you may find that her fuzzy young
owls are already hatched. But these owls are an
exception, and no other bird in our latitude cares
to risk the dangers of late February or early
March.</p>
<p>March is sometimes a woodpecker month, and
almost any day one is very likely to see, besides
the flicker, the hairy or downy woodpecker. The
latter two are almost counterparts of each other,
although the downy is the more common. They
hammer cheerfully upon the sounding boards
which Nature has provided for them, striking slow
or fast, soft or loud, as their humour dictates.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>Near New York, a day in March&mdash;I have found
it varying from March 8 to March 12&mdash;is &#8220;crow
day.&#8221; Now the winter roosts apparently break
up, and all day flocks of crows, sometimes thousands
upon thousands of them, pass to the northward.
If the day is quiet and spring-like, they
fly very high, black motes silhouetted against the
blue,&mdash;but if the day is a &#8220;March day,&#8221; with
whistling, howling winds, then the black fellows
fly close to earth, rising just enough to clear
bushes and trees, and taking leeward advantage
of every protection. For days after, many crows
pass, but never so many as on the first day, when
crow law, or crow instinct, passes the word, we
know not how, which is obeyed by all.</p>
<p>For miles around not a drop of water may be
found; it seems as if every pool and lake were
solid to the bottom, and yet, when we see a large
bird, with goose-like body, long neck and long,
pointed beak, flying like a bullet of steel through
the sky, we may be sure that there is open water
to the northward, for a loon never makes a mistake.
When the first pioneer of these hardy birds
passes, he knows that somewhere beyond us fish
can be caught. If we wonder where he has spent
the long winter months, we should take a steamer
to Florida. Out on the ocean, sometimes a hundred
miles or more from land, many of these birds
make their winter home. When the bow of the
steamer bears down upon one, the bird half
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
spreads its wings, then closes them quickly, and
sinks out of sight in the green depths, not to reappear
until the steamer has passed, when he looks
after us and utters his mocking laugh. Here he
will float until the time comes for him to go north.
We love the brave fellow, remembering him in his
home among the lakes of Canada; but we tremble
for him when we think of the terrible storm waves
which he must outride, and the sneering sharks
which must sometimes spy him. What a story he
could tell of his life among the phalaropes and
jelly-fishes!</p>
<p>Meadow larks are in flocks in March, and as
their yellow breasts, with the central crescent of
black, rise from the snow-bent grass, their long,
clear, vocal &#8220;arrow&#8221; comes to us, piercing the air
like a veritable icicle of sound. When on the
ground they are walkers like the crow.</p>
<p>As the kingfisher and loon appear to know long
ahead when the first bit of clear water will appear,
so the first insect on the wing seems to be anticipated
by a feathered flycatcher. Early some
morning, when the wondrous Northern Lights are
still playing across the heavens, a small voice
may make all the surroundings seem incongruous.
Frosty air, rimmed tree-trunks, naked branches,
aurora&mdash;all seem as unreal as stage properties,
when <i>ph&oelig;-be!</i> comes to our ears. Yes, there is
the little dark-feathered, tail-wagging fellow,
hungry no doubt, but sure that when the sun
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
warms up, Mother Nature will strew his aerial
breakfast-table with tiny gnats,&mdash;precocious, but
none the less toothsome for all that.</p>

<h2>THE WAYS OF MEADOW MICE</h2>
</div>

<p>Day after day we may walk through the
woods and fields, using our eyes as best we
can, searching out every moving thing, following
up every sound,&mdash;and yet we touch only the coarsest,
perceive only the grossest of the life about
us. Tramp the same way after a fall of snow and
we are astonished at the evidences of life of which
we knew nothing. Everywhere, in and out among
the reed stems, around the tree-trunks, and in
wavy lines and spirals all about, runs the delicate
tracery of the meadow mice trails. No leapers
these, as are the white-footed and jumping mice,
but short-legged and stout of body. Yet with all
their lack of size and swiftness, they are untiring
little folk, and probably make long journeys from
their individual nests.</p>
<p>As far north as Canada and west to the Plains
the meadow or field mice are found, and everywhere
they seem to be happy and content. Most
of all, however, they enjoy the vicinity of water,
and a damp, half-marshy meadow is a paradise
for them. No wonder their worst enemies are
known as marsh hawks and marsh owls; these
hunters of the daylight and the night well know
where the meadow mice love to play.</p>
<p>These mice are resourceful little beings and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
when danger threatens they will take to the water
without hesitation; and when the muskrat has
gone the way of the beaver, our ditches and ponds
will not be completely deserted, for the little
meadow mice will swim and dive for many years
thereafter.</p>
<p>Not only in the meadows about our inland
streams, but within sound of the breakers on the
seashore, these vigorous bits of fur find bountiful
living, and it is said that the mice folk inhabiting
these low salt marshes always know in some mysterious
way when a disastrous high tide is due,
and flee in time, so that when the remorseless
ripples lap higher and higher over the wide
stretches of salt grass, not a mouse will be
drowned. By some delicate means of perception
all have been notified in time, and these, among
the least of Nature&#8217;s children, have run and scurried
along their grassy paths to find safety on
the higher ground.</p>
<p>These paths seem an invention of the meadow
mice, and, affording them a unique escape from
danger, they doubtless, in a great measure,
account for the extreme abundance of the little
creatures. When a deer mouse or a chipmunk
emerges from its hollow log or underground tunnel,
it must take its chances in open air. It may
dart along close to the ground or amid an impenetrable
tangle of briers, but still it is always
visible from above. On the other hand, a mole,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
pushing blindly along beneath the sod, fears no
danger from the hawk soaring high overhead.</p>
<p>The method of the meadow mice is between
these two: its stratum of active life is above the
mole and beneath the chipmunk. Scores of sharp
little incisor teeth are forever busy gnawing and
cutting away the tender grass and sprouting
weeds in long meandering paths or trails through
the meadows. As these paths are only a mouse-breadth
in width, the grasses at each side lean
inward, forming a perfect shelter of interlocking
stems overhead. Two purposes are thus fulfilled:
a delicious succulent food is obtained and a way
of escape is kept ever open. These lines intersect
and cross at every conceivable angle, and as the
meadow mice clan are ever friendly toward one
another, any particular mouse seems at liberty
to traverse these miles of mouse alleys.</p>
<p>In winter, when the snow lies deep upon the
ground, these same mice drive tunnels beneath it,
leading to all their favourite feeding grounds, to
all the heavy-seeded weed heads, with which the
bounty of Nature supplies them. But at night
these tunnels are deserted and boldly out upon the
snow come the meadow mice, chasing each other
over its gleaming surface, nibbling the toothsome
seeds, dodging, or trying to dodge, the owl-shadows;
living the keen, strenuous, short, but
happy, life which is that of all the wild meadow
folk.

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
<h2>PROBLEMS OF BIRD LIFE</h2>
</div>

<p>The principal problems which birds, and
indeed all other creatures, have to solve,
have been well stated to be&mdash;Food, Safety, and
Reproduction. In regard to safety, or the art of
escaping danger, we are all familiar with the ravages
which hawks, owls, foxes, and even red squirrels
commit among the lesser feathered creatures,
but there are other dangers which few of us
suspect.</p>
<p>Of all creatures birds are perhaps the most
exempt from liability to accident, yet they not
infrequently lose their lives in most unexpected
ways. Once above trees and buildings, they have
the whole upper air free of every obstacle, and
though their flight sometimes equals the speed of
a railroad train, they have little to fear when well
above the ground. Collision with other birds
seems scarcely possible, although it sometimes
does occur. When a covey of quail is flushed,
occasionally two birds will collide, at times meeting
with such force that both are stunned. Flycatchers
darting at the same insect will now and
then come together, but not hard enough to injure
either bird.</p>
<p>Even the smallest and most wonderful of all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
flyers, the hummingbird, may come to grief in accidental
ways. I have seen one entangled in a burdock
burr, its tiny feathers fast locked into the
countless hooks, and again I have found the body
of one of these little birds with its bill fastened in
a spiral tendril of a grapevine, trapped in some
unknown way.</p>
<p>Young ph&oelig;bes sometimes become entangled in
the horsehairs which are used in the lining of
their nest. When they are old enough to fly and
attempt to leave, they are held prisoners or left
dangling from the nest. When mink traps are set
in the snow in winter, owls frequently fall victims,
mice being scarce and the bait tempting.</p>
<p>Lighthouses are perhaps the cause of more accidents
to birds than are any of the other obstacles
which they encounter on their nocturnal migrations
north and south. Many hundreds of birds
are sometimes found dead at the base of these
structures. The sudden bright glare is so confusing
and blinding, as they shoot from the intense
darkness into its circle of radiance, that they are
completely bewildered and dash headlong against
the thick panes of glass. Telegraph wires are
another menace to low-flying birds, especially
those which, like quail and woodcock, enjoy a
whirlwind flight, and attain great speed within a
few yards. Such birds have been found almost
cut in two by the force with which they struck the
wire.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></p>
<p>The elements frequently catch birds unaware
and overpower them. A sudden wind or storm
will drive coast-flying birds hundreds of miles out
to sea, and oceanic birds may be blown as far
inland. Hurricanes in the West Indies are said to
cause the death of innumerable birds, as well as
of other creatures. From such a cause small
islands are known to have become completely depopulated
of their feathered inhabitants. Violent
hailstorms, coming in warm weather without
warning, are quite common agents in the destruction
of birds, and in a city thousands of English
sparrows have been stricken during such a storm.
After a violent storm of wet snow in the middle
West, myriads of Lapland longspurs were once
found dead in the streets and suburbs of several
villages. On the surface of two small lakes, a
conservative estimate of the dead birds was a million
and a half!</p>
<p>The routes which birds follow in migrating
north and south sometimes extend over considerable
stretches of water, as across the Caribbean
Sea, but the only birds which voluntarily brave
the dangers of the open ocean are those which,
from ability to swim, or great power of flight, can
trust themselves far away from land. Not infrequently
a storm will drive birds away from the
land and carry them over immense distances, and
this accounts for the occasional appearance of
land birds near vessels far out at sea. Overcome
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
with fatigue, they perch for hours in the rigging
before taking flight in the direction of the nearest
land, or, desperate from hunger, they fly fearlessly
down to the deck, where food and water are
seldom refused them.</p>
<p>Small events like these are welcome breaks in
the monotony of a long ocean voyage, but are soon
forgotten at the end of the trip.</p>
<p>Two of these ocean waifs were once brought to
me. One was a young European heron which flew
on board a vessel when it was about two hundred
and five miles southeast of the southern extremity
of India. A storm must have driven the bird seaward,
as there is no migration route near this
locality.</p>
<p>The second bird was a European turtle dove
which was captured not less than seven hundred
and fifty miles from the nearest land&mdash;Ireland.
When caught it was in an exhausted condition,
but it quickly recovered and soon lost all signs of
the buffeting of the storm. The turtle dove
migrates northward to the British Islands about
the first of May, but as this bird was captured on
May 17th, it was not migrating, but, caught by a
gust of wind, was probably blown away from the
land. The force of the storm would then drive it
mile after mile, allowing it no chance of controlling
the direction of its flight, but, from the very
velocity, making it easy for the bird to maintain
its equilibrium.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></p>
<p>Hundreds of birds must perish when left by
storms far out at sea, and the infinitely small
chance of encountering a vessel or other resting-place
makes a bird which has passed through such
an experience and survived, interesting indeed.</p>
<p>In winter ruffed grouse have a habit of burrowing
deep beneath the snow and letting the storm
shut them in. In this warm, cosey retreat they
spend the night, their breath making its way out
through the loosely packed crystals. But when a
cold rain sets in during the night, this becomes a
fatal trap, an impenetrable crust cutting off their
means of escape.</p>
<p>Ducks, when collected about a small open place
in an ice-covered pond, diving for the tender roots
on which they feed, sometimes become confused
and drown before they find their way out. They
have been seen frozen into the ice by hundreds,
sitting there helplessly, and fortunate if the sun,
with its thawing power, releases them before they
are discovered by marauding hawks or foxes.</p>
<p>In connection with their food supply the
greatest enemy of birds is ice, and when a winter
rain ends with a cold snap, and every twig and
seed is encased in a transparent armour of ice,
then starvation stalks close to all the feathered
kindred. Then is the time to scatter crumbs and
grain broadcast, to nail bones and suet to the tree-trunks
and so awaken hope and life in the shivering
little forms. If a bird has food in abundance,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
it little fears the cold. I have kept parrakeets out
through the blizzards and storms of a severe winter,
seeing them play and frolic in the snow as if
their natural home were an arctic tundra, instead
of a tropical forest.</p>
<p>A friend of birds once planted many sprouts of
wild honeysuckle about his porch, and the following
summer two pairs of hummingbirds built their
nests in near-by apple trees; he transplanted
quantities of living woodbine to the garden fences,
and when the robins returned in the spring, after
having remained late the previous autumn feeding
on the succulent bunches of berries, no fewer than
ten pairs nested on and about the porch and yard.</p>
<p>So my text of this, as of many other weeks is,&mdash;study
the food habits of the birds and stock your
waste places with their favourite berry or vine.
Your labour will be repaid a hundredfold in song
and in the society of the little winged comrades.</p>

<h2>DWELLERS IN THE DUST</h2>
</div>

<p>To many of us the differences between a reptile
and a batrachian are unknown. Even if
we have learned that these interesting creatures
are well worth studying and that they possess
few or none of the unpleasant characteristics
usually attributed to them, still we are apt to
speak of having seen a lizard in the water at the
pond&#8217;s edge, or of having heard a reptile croaking
near the marsh. To avoid such mistakes, one
need only remember that reptiles are covered with
scales and that batrachians have smooth skins.</p>
<p>Our walks will become more and more interesting
as we spread our interest over a wider field,
not confining our observations to birds and mammals
alone, but including members of the two
equally distinctive classes of animals mentioned
above. The batrachians, in the northeastern
part of our country, include the salamanders
and newts, the frogs and toads, while as reptiles
we number lizards, turtles, and snakes.</p>
<p>Lizards are creatures of the tropics and only
two small species are found in our vicinity, and
these occur but rarely. Snakes, however, are more
abundant, and, besides the rare poisonous copperhead
and rattlesnake, careful search will reveal a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
dozen harmless species, the commonest, of course,
being the garter snake and its near relative the
ribbon snake.</p>
<p>About this time of the year snakes begin to feel
the thawing effect of the sun&#8217;s rays and to stir in
their long winter hibernation. Sometimes we will
come upon a ball of six or eight intertwined
snakes, which, if they are still frozen up, will lie
motionless upon the ground. But when spring
finally unclasps the seal which has been put upon
tree and ground, these reptiles stretch themselves
full length upon some exposed stone, where they
lie basking in the sun.</p>
<p>The process of shedding the skin soon begins;
getting clear of the head part, eye-scales and all,
the serpent slowly wriggles its way forward,
escaping from the old skin as a finger is drawn
from a glove. At last it crawls away, bright and
shining in its new scaly coat, leaving behind it a
spectral likeness of itself, which slowly sinks and
disintegrates amid the dead leaves and moss, or,
later in the year, it may perhaps be discovered by
some crested flycatcher and carried off to be added
to its nesting material.</p>
<p>When the broods of twenty to thirty young
garter snakes start out in life to hunt for themselves,
then woe to the earthworms, for it is upon
them that the little serpents chiefly feed.</p>
<p>Six or seven of our native species of snakes lay
eggs, usually depositing them under the bark of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
rotten logs, or in similar places, where they are
left to hatch by the heat of the sun or by that of
the decaying vegetation. It is interesting to gather
these leathery shelled eggs and watch them hatch,
and it is surprising how similar to each other
some of the various species are when they emerge
from the shell.</p>

<h2>SPRING SONGSTERS</h2>
</div>

<p>Early April sees the last contest which winter
wages for supremacy, and often it is a
half-hearted attempt; but after the army of the
North has retreated, with its icicles and snowdrifts,
spring seems dazed for a while. Victory
has been dearly bought, and April is the season
when, for a time, the trees and insects hang fire&mdash;paralysed&mdash;while
the chill is thawing from their
marrow. Our northern visitors of the bird world
slip quietly away. There is no great gathering
of clans like that of the tree swallows in the fall,
but silently, one by one, they depart, following the
last moan of the north wind, covering winter&#8217;s
disordered retreat with warbles and songs.</p>
<p>One evening we notice the juncos and tree sparrows
in the tangled, frost-burned stubble, and the
next day, although our eye catches glints of white
from sparrow tails, it is from vesper finches, not
from juncos, and the weed spray which a few
hours before bent beneath a white-throat&#8217;s weight,
now vibrates with the energy which a field sparrow
puts into his song. Field and chipping sparrows,
which now come in numbers, are somewhat
alike, but by their beaks and songs you may know
them. The mandibles of the former are flesh-coloured,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
those of the latter black. The sharp
<i>chip!</i> <i>chip!</i> is characteristic of the &#8220;chippy,&#8221; but
the sweet, dripping song of the field sparrow is
charming. No elaborate performance this, but a
succession of sweet, high notes, accelerating toward
the end, like a coin of silver settling to rest
on a marble table&mdash;a simple, chaste vespers which
rises to the setting sun and endears the little
brown singer to us.</p>
<p>We may learn much by studying these homely
little frequenters of our orchards and pastures;
each has a hundred secrets which await patient
and careful watching by their human lovers. In
the chipping sparrow we may notice a hint of the
spring change of dress which warblers and tanagers
carry to such an extreme. When he left us
in the fall he wore a dull-streaked cap, but now
he comes from the South attired in a smart head-covering
of bright chestnut. Poor little fellow,
this is the very best he can do in the way of especial
ornament to bewitch his lady love, but it
suffices. Can the peacock&#8217;s train do more?</p>
<p>This is the time to watch for the lines of ducks
crossing the sky, and be ready to find black ducks
in the oddest places&mdash;even in insignificant rain
pools deep in the woods. In the early spring the
great flocks of grackles and redwings return,
among the first to arrive as they were the last to
leave for the South.</p>
<p>Before the last fox sparrow goes, the hermit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
thrush comes, and these birds, alike in certain
superficialities, but so actually unrelated, for a
time seek their food in the same grove.</p>
<p>The hardier of the warblers pass us in April,
stopping a few days before continuing to the
northward. We should make haste to identify
them and to learn all we can of their notes and
habits, not only because of the short stay which
most of them make, but on account of the vast
assemblage of warbler species already on the
move in the Southern States, which soon, in panoply
of rainbow hues, will crowd our groves and
wear thin the warbler pages of our bird books.</p>
<p>These April days we are sure to see flocks of
myrtle, or yellow-rumped warblers, and yellow
palm warblers in their olive-green coats and chestnut
caps. The black-and-white creeper will always
show himself true to his name&mdash;a creeping bundle
of black and white streaks. When we hear of the
parula warbler or of the Cape May warbler we
get no idea of the appearance of the bird, but when
we know that the black-throated green warblers
begin to appear in April, the first good view of
one of this species will proclaim him as such.</p>
<p>We have marked the fox sparrow as being a
great scratcher among dead leaves. His habit is
continued in the spring by the towhee, or chewink,
who uses the same methods, throwing both
feet backward simultaneously. The ordinary call
note of this bird is a good example of how difficult
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
it is to translate bird songs into human words.
Listen to the quick, double note coming from the
underbrush. Now he says &#8220;<i>towhee&#8217;!</i>&#8221; the next
time &#8220;<i>chewink&#8217;!</i>&#8221; You may change about at will,
and the notes will always correspond. Whatever
is in our mind at the instant, that will seem to
be what the bird says. This should warn us of
the danger of reading our thoughts and theories
too much into the minds and actions of birds.
Their mental processes, in many ways, correspond
to ours. When a bird expresses fear, hate,
bravery, pain or pleasure, we can sympathise
thoroughly with it, but in studying their more
complex actions we should endeavour to exclude
the thousand and one human attributes with
which we are prone to colour the bird&#8217;s mental
environment.</p>
<p>John Burroughs has rendered the song of the
black-throated green warbler in an inimitable way,
as follows: &#8220;&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;V&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221; When we have
once heard the bird we will instantly recognise
the aptness of these symbolic lines. The least
flycatcher, called <i>minimus</i> by the scientists, well
deserves his name, for of all those members of
his family which make their home with us, he is
the smallest. These miniature flycatchers have a
way of hunting which is all their own. They sit
perched on some exposed twig or branch, motionless
until some small insect flies in sight. Then
they will launch out into the air, and, catching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
the insect with a snap of their beaks, fly back to
the same perch. They are garbed in subdued
grays, olives, and yellows. The least flycatcher
has another name which at once distinguishes him&mdash;chebec&#8217;.
As he sits on a limb, his whole body
trembles when he jerks out these syllables, and his
tail snaps as if it played some important part in
the mechanism of his vocal effort.</p>
<p>When you are picking cowslips and hepaticas
early in the month, keep a lookout for the first
barn swallow. Nothing gives us such an impression
of the independence and individuality of
birds as when a solitary member of some species
arrives days before others of his kind. One fork-tailed
beauty of last year&#8217;s nest above the haymow
may hawk about for insects day after day
alone, before he is joined by other swallows. Did
he spend the winter by himself, or did the <i>heimweh</i>
smite his heart more sorely and bring him
irresistibly to the loved nest in the rafters? This
love of home, which is so striking an attribute of
birds, is a wonderfully beautiful thing. It brings
the oriole back to the branch where still swings
her exquisite purse-shaped home of last summer;
it leads each pair of fishhawks to their particular
cartload of sticks, to which a few more must be
added each year; it hastens the wing beats of the
sea-swallows northward to the beach which, ten
months ago, was flecked with their eggs&mdash;the
shifting grains of sand their only nest.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></p>
<p>This love of home, of birthplace, bridges over a
thousand physical differences between these
feathered creatures and ourselves. We forget
their expressionless masks of horn, their feathered
fingers, their scaly toes, and looking deep
into their clear, bright eyes, we know and feel a
kinship, a sympathy of spirit, which binds us all
together, and we are glad.</p>

<h2>THE SIMPLE ART OF SAPSUCKING</h2>
</div>

<p>The yellow-bellied sapsucker is, at this time
of year, one of our most abundant woodpeckers,
and in its life we have an excellent
example of that individuality which is ever cropping
out in Nature&mdash;the trial and acceptance of
life under new conditions.</p>
<p>In the spring we tap the sugar maples, and
gather great pailfuls of the sap as it rises from its
winter resting-place in the roots, and the sapsucker
likes to steal from our pails or to tap the
trees for himself. But throughout part of the
year he is satisfied with an insect diet and chooses
the time when the sap begins to flow downward
in the autumn for committing his most serious
depredations upon the tree. It was formerly
thought that this bird, like its near relatives, the
downy and hairy woodpeckers, was forever boring
for insects; but when we examine the regularity
and symmetry of the arrangement of its holes,
we realise that they are for a very different purpose
than the exposing of an occasional grub.</p>
<p>Besides drinking the sap from the holes, this
bird extracts a quantity of the tender inner bark
of the tree, and when a tree has been encircled
for several feet up and down its trunk by these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
numerous little sap wells, the effect becomes apparent
in the lessened circulation of the liquid
blood of the tree; and before long, death is certain
to ensue. So the work of the sapsucker is injurious,
while the grub-seeking woodpeckers confer
only good upon the trees they frequent.</p>
<p>And how pitiful is the downfall of a doomed
tree! Hardly has its vitality been lessened an
appreciable amount, when somehow the word is
passed to the insect hordes who hover about in
waiting, as wolves hang upon the outskirts of a
herd of buffalo. In the spring, when the topmost
branches have received a little less than their
wonted amount of wholesome sap and the leaves
are less vigorous, the caterpillars and twig-girdlers
attack at once. Ichneumen flies and boring
beetles seem to know by signs invisible to us
that here is opportunity. Then in the fall come
again the sapsuckers to the tree, remorselessly
driving hole after hole through the still untouched
segments of its circle of life. When the last sap-channel
is pierced and no more can pass to the
roots, the tree stands helpless, waiting for the
end. Swiftly come frost and rain, and when the
April suns again quicken all the surrounding
vegetation into vigorous life, the victim of the
sapsuckers stands lifeless, its branches reaching
hopelessly upward, a naked mockery amid the
warm green foliage around. Insects and fungi
and lightning now set to work unhindered, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
the tree falls at last,&mdash;dust to dust&mdash;ashes to
ashes.</p>
<p>A sapsucker has been seen in early morning to
sink forty or fifty wells into the bark of a mountain
ash tree, and then to spend the rest of the
day in sidling from one to another, taking a sip
here and a drink there, gradually becoming more
and more lethargic and drowsy, as if the sap
actually produced some narcotic or intoxicating
effect. Strong indeed is the contrast between such
a picture and the same bird in the early spring,&mdash;then
full of life and vigour, drawing musical reverberations
from some resonant hollow limb.</p>
<p>Like other idlers, the sapsucker in its deeds of
gluttony and harm brings, if anything, more injury
to others than to itself. The farmers well
know its depredations and detest it accordingly,
but unfortunately they are not ornithologists, and
a peckerwood is a peckerwood to them; and so
while the poor downy, the red-head, and the hairy
woodpeckers are seen busily at work cutting the
life threads of the injurious borer larvæ, the
farmer, thinking of his dying trees, slays them all
without mercy or distinction. The sapsucker is
never as confiding as the downy, and from a safe
distance sees others murdered for sins which are
his alone.</p>
<p>But we must give sapsucker his due and admit
that he devours many hundreds of insects
throughout the year, and though we mourn the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
death of an occasional tree, we cannot but admire
his new venture in life,&mdash;his cunning in choosing
only the dessert served at the woodpeckers&#8217;
feasts,&mdash;the sweets which flow at the tap of a
beak, leaving to his fellows the labour of searching
and drilling deep for more substantial courses.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
<h2>WILD WINGS</h2>
</div>

<p>The ides of March see the woodcock back in
its northern home, and in early April it prepares
for nesting. The question of the nest itself
is a very simple matter, being only a cavity,
formed by the pressure of the mother&#8217;s body,
among the moss and dead leaves. The formalities
of courtship are, however, quite another thing,
and the execution of interesting aerial dances
entails much effort and time.</p>
<p>It is in the dusk of evening that the male woodcock
begins his song,&mdash;plaintive notes uttered at
regular intervals, and sounding like <i>peent!</i> <i>peent!</i>
Then without warning he launches himself on a
sharply ascending spiral, his wings whistling
through the gloom. Higher and higher he goes,
balances a moment, and finally descends abruptly,
with zigzag rushes, wings and voice both aiding
each other in producing the sounds, to which, let
us suppose, his prospective mate listens with
ecstasy. It is a weird performance, repeated
again and again during the same evening.</p>
<p>So pronounced and loud is the whistling of the
wings that we wonder how it can be produced by
ordinary feathers. The three outer primaries
of the wing, which in most birds are usually like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
the others, in the woodcock are very stiff, and
the vanes are so narrow that when the wing is
spread there is a wide space between each one.
When the wing beats the air rapidly, the wind
rushes through these feather slits,&mdash;and we have
the accompaniment of the love-song explained.</p>
<p>The feather-covered arms and hands of birds
are full of interest; and after studying the wing
of a chicken which has been plucked for the table,
we shall realise how wonderful a transformation
has taken place through the millions of years past.
Only three stubby fingers are left and these are
stiff and almost immovable, but the rest of the
forearm is very like that of our own arm.</p>
<p>See how many facts we can accumulate about
wings, by giving special attention to them, when
watching birds fly across the sky. How easy it
is to identify the steady beats of a crow, or the
more rapid strokes of a duck; how distinctive is
the frequent looping flight of a goldfinch, or the
longer, more direct swings of a woodpecker!</p>
<p>Hardly any two birds have wings exactly
similar in shape, every wing being exquisitely
adapted to its owner&#8217;s needs. The gull soars or
flaps slowly on his long, narrow, tireless pinions,
while the quail rises suddenly before us on short,
rounded wings, which carry it like a rocket for a
short distance, when it settles quickly to earth
again. The gull would fare ill were it compelled
to traverse the ocean with such brief spurts of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
speed, while, on the other hand, the last bob-white
would shortly vanish, could it escape from fox
or weasel only with the slow flight of a gull. How
splendidly the sickle wings of a swift enable it
to turn and twist, bat-like, in its pursuit of
insects!</p>
<p>You may be able to identify any bird near your
home, you may know its nest and eggs, its song
and its young; but begin at the beginning again
and watch their wings and their feet and their
bills and you will find that there are new and
wonderful truths at your very doorstep. Try
bringing home from your walk a list of bill-uses
or feet-functions. Remember that a familiar
object, looked at from a new point of view, will
take to itself unthought-of significance.</p>

<h2>THE BIRDS IN THE MOON</h2>
</div>

<p>The lover of birds who has spent the day in
the field puts away his glasses at nightfall,
looking forward to a walk after dark only as
a chance to hear the call of nocturnal birds or to
catch the whirr of a passing wing. But some
bright moonlight night in early May, or again in
mid September, unsheath your glasses and tie
them, telescope-fashion, to a window-ledge or railing.
Seat yourself in an easy position and focus
on the moon. Shut out all earthly scenes from
your mind and imagine yourself wandering amid
those arid wastes. What a scene of cosmic desolation!
What vast deserts, and gaping craters of
barren rock! The cold, steel-white planet seems
of all things most typical of death.</p>
<p>But those specks passing across its surface?
At first you imagine they are motes clogging the
delicate blood-vessels of the retina; then you
wonder if a distant host of falling meteors could
have passed. Soon a larger, nearer mote appears;
the moon and its craters are forgotten and
with a thrill of delight you realise that they are
birds&mdash;living, flying birds&mdash;of all earthly things
typical of the most vital life! Migration is at its
height, the chirps and twitters which come from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
the surrounding darkness are tantalising hints
telling of the passing legions. Thousands and
thousands of birds are every night pouring northward
in a swift, invisible, aerial stream.</p>
<p>As a projecting pebble in mid-stream blurs the
transparent water with a myriad bubbles, so the
narrow path of moon-rays, which our glass reveals,
cute a swath of visibility straight through
the host of birds to our eager eyes. How we hate
to lose an instant&#8217;s opportunity! Even a wink
may allow a familiar form to pass unseen. If we
can use a small telescope, the field of view is much
enlarged. Now and then we recognise the flight
of some particular species,&mdash;the swinging loop of
a woodpecker or goldfinch, or the flutter of a
sandpiper.</p>
<p>It has been computed that these birds sometimes
fly as much as a mile or more above the surface
of the earth, and when we think of the tiny,
fluttering things at this terrible height, it takes
our breath away. What a panorama of dark
earth and glistening river and ocean must be
spread out beneath them! How the big moon
must glow in that rarefied air! How diminutive
and puerile must seem the houses and cities of
human fashioning!</p>
<p>The instinct of migration is one of the most
wonderful in the world. A young bob-white and
a bobolink are hatched in the same New England
field. The former grows up and during the fall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
and winter forms one of the covey which is content
to wander a mile or two, here and there, in
search of good feeding grounds. Hardly has the
bobolink donned his first full dress before an irresistible
impulse seizes him. One night he rises
up and up, ever higher on fluttering wings, sets
his course southward, gives you a glimpse of him
across the moon, and keeps on through Virginia
to Florida, across seas, over tropical islands, far
into South America, never content until he has
put the great Amazon between him and his far
distant birthplace.</p>

<a name='THE_HIGH_TIDE_OF_BIRD_LIFE' id='THE_HIGH_TIDE_OF_BIRD_LIFE'></a>
<h2>THE HIGH TIDE OF BIRD LIFE</h2>
</div>

<p>For abundance and for perfection of song
and plumage, of the whole year, May is the
month of birds. Insects appear slowly in the
spring and are numerous all summer; squirrels
and mice are more or less in evidence during all
the twelve months; reptiles unearth themselves
at the approach of the warm weather, and may
be found living their slow, sluggish life until late
in the fall. In eggs, cocoons, discarded bird&#8217;s-nests,
in earthen burrows, or in the mud at the
bottom of pond or stream, all these creatures have
spent the winter near where we find them in the
spring. But birds are like creatures of another
world; and, although in every summer&#8217;s walk we
may see turtles, birds, butterflies, and chipmunks,
all interweaving their life paths across one another&#8217;s
haunts, yet the power of extended flight
and the wonderful habit of continental migration
set birds apart from all other living creatures.
A bird during its lifetime has almost twice the
conscious existence of, say, a snake or any hibernating
mammal. And now in early May, when
the creatures of the woods and fields have only
recently opened their sleepy eyes and stretched
their thin forms, there comes the great worldwide
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
army of the birds, whose bright eyes peer at
us from tree, thicket, and field, whose brilliant
feathers and sweet songs bring summer with a
leap&mdash;the height of the grand symphony, of which
the vernal peeping of the frogs and the squirrels&#8217;
chatter were only the first notes of the prelude.</p>
<p>Tantalus-like is the condition of the amateur
bird-lover, who, book in hand, vainly endeavours
to identify the countless beautiful forms which
appear in such vast numbers, linger a few days
and then disappear, passing on to the northward,
but leaving behind a goodly assemblage which
spends the summer and gives abundant opportunity
for study during the succeeding months. In
May it is the migrants which we should watch,
and listen to, and &#8220;ogle&#8221; with our opera glasses.
Like many other evanescent things, those birds
which have made their winter home in Central
America&mdash;land yet beyond our travels&mdash;and
which use our groves merely as half-way houses
on their journey to the land of their birth, the
balsams of Quebec, or the unknown wastes of
Labrador, seem most precious, most worthy at
this time of our closest observation.</p>
<p>More confusing&mdash;albeit the more delightful&mdash;is
a season when continued cold weather and chilly
rains hold back all but the hardiest birds, until&mdash;like
the dammed-up piles of logs trembling with
the spring freshets&mdash;the tropic winds carry all
before them, and all at once winter birds which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
have sojourned only a few miles south of us,
summer residents which should have appeared
weeks ago, together with the great host of Canadian
and other nesters of the north, appear
within a few days&#8217; time.</p>
<p>A backward season brings strangers into close
company for a while. A white-throat sings his
clear song of the North, and a moment later is
answered by an oriole&#8217;s melody, or the sweet
tones of a rose-breasted grosbeak&mdash;the latter one
of those rarely favoured birds, exquisite in both
plumage and song.</p>
<p>The glories of our May bird life are the wood
warblers, and innumerable they must seem to one
who is just beginning his studies; indeed, there
are over seventy species that find their way into
the United States. Many are named from the
distribution of colour upon their plumage&mdash;the
blue-winged yellow, the black-throated blue, chestnut-sided,
bay-breasted, and black poll. Perhaps
the two most beautiful&mdash;most reflective of bright
tropical skies and flowers&mdash;are the magnolia and
the blackburnian. The first fairly dazzles us with
its bluish crown, white and black face, black and
olive-green back, white marked wings and tail,
yellow throat and rump, and strongly streaked
breast. The blackburnian is an exquisite little
fellow, marked with white and black, but with the
crown, several patches on the face, the throat
and breast of a rich warm orange that glows
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
amid the green foliage like a living coal of fire.
The black poll warbler is an easy bird to identify;
but do not expect to recognise it when it returns
from the North in the fall. Its black crown has
disappeared, and in general it looks like a different
bird.</p>
<p>At the present time when the dogwood blossoms
are in their full perfection, and the branches and
twigs of the trees are not yet hidden, but their
outlines only softened by the light, feathery foliage,
the tanagers and orioles have their day.
Nesting cares have not yet made them fearful of
showing their bright plumage, and scores of the
scarlet and orange forms play among the
branches.</p>
<p>The flycatchers and vireos now appear in force&mdash;little
hunters of insects clad in leafy greens and
browns, with now and then a touch of brightness&mdash;as
in the yellow-throated vireo or in the crest
of the kingbird.</p>
<p>The lesser sandpipers, both the spotted and the
solitary, teeter along the brooks and ponds, and
probe the shallows for tiny worms. Near the
woody streams the so-called water thrushes
spring up before us. Strange birds these, in appearance
like thrushes, in their haunts and in
their teetering motion like sandpipers, but in
reality belonging to the same family as the tree-loving
wood warblers. A problem not yet solved
by ornithologists is: what was the mode of life of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
the ancestor of the many warblers? Did he cling
to and creep along the bark, as the black-and-white
warbler, or feed from the ground or the
thicket as does the worm-eating? Did he snatch
flies on the wing as the necklaced Canadian warbler,
or glean from the brook&#8217;s edge as our water
thrush? The struggle for existence has not been
absent from the lives of these light-hearted little
fellows, and they have had to be jack-of-all-trades
in their search for food.</p>
<p>The gnats and other flying insects have indeed
to take many chances when they slip from their
cocoons and dance up and down in the warm sunlight!
Lucky for their race that there are millions
instead of thousands of them; for now the swifts
and great numbers of tree and barn swallows
spend the livelong day in swooping after the
unfortunate gauzy-winged motes, which have
risen above the toad&#8217;s maw upon land, and beyond
the reach of the trout&#8217;s leap over the water.</p>
<p>It would take an article as long as this simply
to mention hardly more than the names of the
birds that we may observe during a walk in May;
and with bird book and glasses we must see for
ourselves the bobolinks in the broad meadows,
the cowbirds and rusty blackbirds, and, pushing
through the lady-slipper marshes, we may surprise
the solitary great blue and the little green
herons at their silent fishing.</p>
<p>No matter how late the spring may be, the great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
migration host will reach its height from the
tenth to the fifteenth of the month. From this
until June first, migrants will be passing, but in
fewer and fewer numbers, until the balance comes
to rest again, and we may cease from the strenuous
labours of the last few weeks, confident that
those birds that remain will be the builders of
the nests near our homes&mdash;nests that they know
so well how to hide. Even before the last day of
May passes, we see many young birds on their
first weak-winged flights, such as bluebirds and
robins; but June is the great month of bird homes,
as to May belong the migrants.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
<h2>ANIMAL FASHIONS</h2>
</div>

<p>Warm spring days bring other changes than
thawing snowbanks and the swelling buds
and leaves, which seem to grow almost visibly. It
is surprising how many of the wild folk meet
the spring with changed appearance&mdash;beautiful,
fantastic or ugly to us; all, perhaps, beautiful to
them and to their mates.</p>
<p>As a rule we find the conditions which exist
among ourselves reversed among the animals;
the male &#8220;blossoms forth like the rose,&#8221; while
the female&#8217;s sombre winter fur or feathers are
reduplicated only by a thinner coat for summer.
The &#8220;spring opening&#8221; of the great classes of
birds and animals is none the less interesting because
its styles are not set by Parisian modistes.</p>
<p>The most gorgeous display of all is to be found
among the birds, the peacock leading in conspicuousness
and self-consciousness. What a contrast
to the dull earthy-hued little hen, for whose
slightest favour he neglects food to raise his Argus-eyed
fan, clattering his quill castanets and
screaming challenges to his rivals! He will even
fight bloody battles with invading suitors; and,
after all, failure may be the result. Imagine the
feelings of two superb birds fighting over a winsome
browny, to see her&mdash;as I have done&mdash;walk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
off with a spurless, half-plumaged young cock!</p>
<p>The males of many birds, such as the scarlet
tanager and the indigo bunting, assume during
the winter the sombre green or brown hue of the
female, changing in spring to a glorious scarlet
and black, or to an exquisite indigo colour respectively.
Not only do most of the females of
the feathered world retain their dull coats
throughout the year, but some deface even this
to form feather beds for the precious eggs and
nestlings, to protect which bright colours must
be entirely foregone.</p>
<p>The spring is the time when decorations are
seen at their best. The snowy egret trails his
filmy cloud of plumes, putting to shame the stiff
millinery bunches of similar feathers torn from
his murdered brethren. Even the awkward and
querulous night heron exhibits a long curling
plume or two. And what a strange criterion of
beauty a female white pelican must have! To be
sure, the graceful crest which Sir Pelican erects
is beautiful, but that huge, horny &#8220;keel&#8221; or
&#8220;sight&#8221; on his bill! What use can it subserve,
æsthetic or otherwise? One would think that
such a structure growing so near his eyes, and
day by day becoming taller, must occupy much of
his attention.</p>
<p>The sheldrake ducks also have a fleshy growth
on the bill. A turkey gobbler, when his vernal
wedding dress is complete, is indeed a remarkable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
sight. The mass of wattles, usually so gray and
shrunken, is now of most vivid hues&mdash;scarlet, blue,
vermilion, green,&mdash;the fleshy tassels and swollen
knobs making him a most extraordinary creature.</p>
<p>Birds are noted for taking exquisite care of
their plumage, and if the feathers become at all
dingy or unkempt, we know the bird is in bad
health.</p>
<p>What a time the deer and the bears, the squirrels
and the mice, have when changing their
dress! Rags and tatters; tatters and rags! One
can grasp a handful of hair on the flank of a
caribou or elk in a zoological park, and the whole
will come out like thistledown; while underneath
is seen the sleek, short summer coat. A bear will
sometimes carry a few locks of the long, brown
winter fur for months after the clean black hairs
of the summer&#8217;s coat are grown. What a boon to
human tailors such an opportunity would be&mdash;to
ordain that Mr. X. must wear the faded collar
or vest of his old suit until bills are paid!</p>
<p>It is a poor substance, indeed, which, when cast
aside, is not available for some secondary use in
Nature&#8217;s realm; and the hairs that fall from animals
are not all left to return unused to their
original elements. The sharp eyes of birds spy
them out, and thus the lining to many a nest is
furnished. I knew of one feathered seeker of
cast-off clothing which met disaster through trying
to get a supply at first hand&mdash;a sparrow was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
found dead, tangled in the hairs of a pony&#8217;s tail.
The chickadee often lights on the backs of domestic
cattle and plucks out hair with which to line
some snug cavity near by for his nest. Before
the cattle came his ancestors were undoubtedly
in the habit of helping themselves from the deer&#8217;s
stock of &#8220;ole clo&#8217;s,&#8221; as they have been observed
getting their building material from the deer in
zoological parks.</p>
<p>Of course the hair of deer and similar animals
falls out with the motions of the creatures, or
is brushed out by bushes and twigs; but we must
hope that the shedding place of a porcupine is at
a distance from his customary haunts; it would
be so uncomfortable to run across a shred of
one&#8217;s old clothes&mdash;if one were a porcupine!</p>
<p>The skin of birds and animals wears away in
small flakes, but when a reptile changes to a new
suit of clothes, the old is shed almost entire. A
frog after shedding its skin will very often turn
round and swallow it, establishing the frog maxim
&#8220;every frog his own old clothes bag!&#8221;</p>
<p>Birds, which exhibit so many idiosyncrasies,
appear again as utilizers of old clothes; although
when a crested flycatcher weaves a long snake-skin
into the fabric of its nest, it seems more from the
standpoint of a curio collector&mdash;as some people
delight in old worn brass and blue china! There
is another if less artistic theory for this peculiarity
of the crested flycatcher. The skin of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
snake&mdash;a perfect ghost in its completeness&mdash;would
make a splendid &#8220;bogie.&#8221; We can see that
it might, indeed, be useful in such a way, as in
frightening marauding crows, who approach with
cannibalistic intentions upon eggs or young.
Thus the skin would correspond in function to
the rows of dummy wooden guns, which make a
weak fort appear all but invincible.</p>

<h2>POLLIWOG PROBLEMS</h2>
</div>

<p>The ancient Ph&oelig;nicians, Egyptians, Hindus,
Japanese, and Greeks all shared the belief
that the whole world was hatched from an egg
made by the Creator. This idea of development
is at least true in the case of every living thing
upon the earth to-day; every plant springs from
its seed, every animal from its egg. And still
another sweeping, all-inclusive statement may be
made,&mdash;every seed or egg at first consists of but
one cell, and by the division of this into many
cells, the lichen, violet, tree, worm, crab, butterfly,
fish, frog, or other higher creature is formed.
A little embryology will give a new impetus to
our studies, whether we watch the unfolding
leaves of a sunflower, a caterpillar emerging from
its egg, or a chick breaking through its shell.</p>
<p>The very simplest and best way to begin this
study is to go to the nearest pond, where the
frogs have been croaking in the evenings. A
search among the dead leaves and water-soaked
sticks will reveal a long string of black beads.
These are the eggs of the toad; if, however, the
beads are not in strings, but in irregular masses,
then they are frogs&#8217; eggs. In any case take home
a tumblerful, place a few, together with the thick,
transparent gelatine, in which they are encased,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
in a saucer, and examine them carefully under
a good magnifying glass, or, better still, through
a low-power microscope lens.</p>
<p>You will notice that the tiny spheres are not
uniformly coloured but that half is whitish. If
the eggs have been recently laid the surface will
be smooth and unmarked, but have patience and
watch them for as long a time as you can spare.
Whenever I can get a batch of such eggs, I never
grudge a whole day spent in observing them, for
it is seldom that the mysterious processes of life
are so readily watched and followed.</p>
<p>Keep your eye fixed on the little black and white
ball of jelly and before long, gradually and yet
with never a halt, a tiny furrow makes its way
across the surface, dividing the egg into equal
halves. When it completely encircles the sphere
you may know that you have seen one of the
greatest wonders of the world. The egg which
consisted of but one cell is now divided into two
exactly equal parts, of the deepest significance.
Of the latter truth we may judge from the fact
that if one of those cells should be injured, only
one-half a polliwog would result,&mdash;either a head
or a tail half.</p>
<p>Before long the unseen hand of life ploughs another
furrow across the egg, and we have now
four cells. These divide into eight, sixteen, and so
on far beyond human powers of numeration, until
the beginnings of all the organs of the tadpole
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
are formed. While we cannot, of course, follow
this development, we can look at our egg every
day and at last see the little <i>wiggle heads</i> or polliwogs
(from <i>pol</i> and <i>wiggle</i>) emerge.</p>
<p>In a few days they develop a fin around the tail,
and from now on it is an easy matter to watch
the daily growth. There is no greater miracle in
the world than to see one of these aquatic, water-breathing,
limbless creatures transform before
your eyes into a terrestrial, four-legged frog or
toad, breathing air like ourselves. The humble
polliwog in its development is significant of far
more marvellous facts than the caterpillar changing
into the butterfly, embodying as it does the
deepest poetry and romance of evolution.</p>

<h2>INSECT PIRATES AND SUBMARINES</h2>
</div>

<p>Far out on the ocean, when the vessel is laboriously
making her way through the troughs
and over the crests of the great waves, little birds,
black save for a patch of white on the lower back,
are a common sight, flying with quick irregular
wing-beats, close to the surface of the troubled
waters. When they spy some edible bit floating
beneath them, down they drop until their tiny
webbed feet just rest upon the water. Then,
snatching up the titbit, half-flying, they patter
along the surface of the water, just missing being
engulfed by each oncoming wave. Thus they have
come to be named petrels&mdash;little Peters&mdash;because
they seem to walk upon the water. Without aid
from the wings, however, they would soon be immersed,
so the walking is only an illusion.</p>
<p>But in our smallest ponds and brooks we may
see this miracle taking place almost daily, the
feat being accomplished by a very interesting
little assemblage of insects, commonly called
water skaters or striders. Let us place our eyes
as near as possible to the surface of the water
and watch the little creatures darting here and
there.</p>
<p>We see that they progress securely on the top
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
of the water, resting upon it as if it were a sheet
of ice. Their feet are so adapted that the water
only dimples beneath their slight weight, the extent
of the depression not being visible to the eye,
but clearly outlined in the shadows upon the bottom.
In an eddy of air a tiny fly is caught and
whirled upon the water, where it struggles vigorously,
striving to lift its wings clear of the surface.
In an instant the water strider&mdash;pirate of the pond
that he is&mdash;reaches forward his crooked fore
legs, and here endeth the career of the unfortunate
fly.</p>
<p>In the air, in the earth, and below the surface
of the water are hundreds of living creatures, but
the water striders and their near relatives are
unique. No other group shares their power of
actually walking, or rather pushing themselves,
upon the surface of the water. They have a little
piece of the world all to themselves. Yet, although
three fifths of the earth&#8217;s surface consists
of water, this group of insects is a small one. A
very few, however, are found out upon the ocean,
where the tiny creatures row themselves cheerfully
along. It is thought that they attach their
eggs to the floating saragassum seaweed. If only
we knew the whole life of one of these ocean
water striders and all the strange sights it must
see, a fairy story indeed would be unfolded to us.</p>
<p>However, all the Lilliputian craft of our brooks
are not galleys; there are submarines, which, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
excellence of action and control, put to shame all
human efforts along the same line. These are the
water boatmen, stout boat-shaped insects whose
hind legs are long, projecting outward like the
oars of a rowboat. They feather their oars, too,
or rather the oars are feathered for them, a fringe
of long hairs growing out on each side of the
blade. Some of the boatmen swim upside down,
and these have the back keeled instead of the
breast. Like real submarine boats, these insects
have to come up for air occasionally; and, again
like similar craft of human handiwork, their principal
mission in life seems to be warfare upon the
weaker creatures about them.</p>
<p>Upon their bodies are many short hairs that
have the power of enclosing and retaining a good-sized
bubble of air. Thus the little boatman is
well supplied for each submarine trip, and he does
not have to return to the surface until all this
storage air has been exhausted. In perfectly pure
water, however, these boatmen can remain almost
indefinitely below the surface, although it is not
known how they obtain from the water the oxygen
which they usually take from the air.</p>
<p>All of these skaters and boatmen thrive in small
aquariums, and if given pieces of scraped meat
will live in perfect health. Here is an alluring
opportunity for anyone to add to our knowledge
of insect life; for the most recent scientific books
admit that we do not yet know the complete life
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
history of even one of these little brothers of the
pond.</p>

<h2>THE VICTORY OF THE NIGHTHAWK</h2>
</div>

<p>The time is not far distant when the bottom
of the sea will be the only place where
primeval wildness will not have been defiled or
destroyed by man. He may sail his ships above,
he may peer downward, even dare to descend a
few feet in a suit of rubber or a submarine boat,
or he may scratch a tiny furrow for a few yards
with a dredge: but that is all.</p>
<p>When that time comes, the animals and birds
which survive will be only those which have found
a way to adapt themselves to man&#8217;s encroaching,
all-pervading civilisation. The time was when
our far-distant ancestors had, year in and year
out, to fight for very existence against the wild
creatures about them. They then gained the
upper hand, and from that time to the present
the only question has been, how long the wild
creatures of the earth could hold out.</p>
<p>The wolf, the bison, the beaver fought the battle
out at once to all but the bitter end. The
crow, the muskrat, the fox have more than held
their own, by reason of cunning, hiding or quickness
of sight; but they cannot hope for this to
last. The English sparrow has won by sheer
audacity; but most to be admired are those creatures
which have so changed their habits that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
some product of man&#8217;s invention serves them as
well as did their former wilderness home. The
eave swallow and barn swallow and the chimney
swift all belie their names in the few wild haunts
still uninvaded by man. The first two were originally
cliff and bank haunters, and the latter&#8217;s
home was a lightning-hollowed tree.</p>
<p>But the nighthawks which soar and boom above
our city streets, whence come they? Do they
make daily pilgrimages from distant woods? The
city furnishes no forest floor on which they may
lay their eggs. Let us seek a wide expanse of flat
roof, high above the noisy, crowded streets. Let
it be one of those tar and pebble affairs, so unpleasant
to walk upon, but so efficient in shedding
water. If we are fortunate, as we walk slowly
across the roof, a something, like a brownish bit
of wind-blown rubbish, will roll and tumble ahead
of us. It is a bird with a broken wing, we say.
How did it ever get up here? We hasten forward
to pick it up, when, with a last desperate flutter,
it topples off the edge of the roof; but instead of
falling helplessly to the street, the bird swings
out above the house-tops, on the white-barred pinions
of a nighthawk. Now mark the place where
first we observed the bird, and approach it carefully,
crawling on hands and knees. Otherwise
we will very probably crush the two mottled bits
of shell, so exactly like pebbles in external appearance,
but sheltering two little warm, beating
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
hearts. Soon the shells will crack, and the young
nighthawks will emerge,&mdash;tiny fluffs,&mdash;in colour
the very essence of the scattered pebbles.</p>
<p>In the autumn they will all pass southward to
the far distant tropics, and when spring again
awakens, the instinct of migration will lead them,
not to some mottled carpet of moss and rocks deep
in the woods, but to the tarred roof of a house in
the very heart of a great city.</p>

<h2>THE GALA DAYS OF BIRDS</h2>
</div>

<p>Migration is over, and the great influx of
birds which last month filled every tree and
bush is now distributed over field and wood, from
our dooryard and lintel vine to the furthermost
limits of northern exploration; birds, perhaps,
having discovered the pole long years ago. Now
every feather and plume is at its brightest and
full development; for must not the fastidious
females be sought and won?</p>
<p>And now the great struggle of the year is at
hand, the supreme moment for which thousands
of throats have been vibrating with whispered
rehearsals of trills and songs, and for which the
dangers that threaten the acquisition of bright
colours and long, inconvenient plumes and ornaments
have been patiently undergone. Now, if all
goes well and his song is clear, if his crest and
gorgeous splashes of tints and shades are fresh
and shining with the gloss of health, then the
feathered lover may hope, indeed, that the little
brown mate may look with favour upon dance,
song, or antic&mdash;and the home is become a reality.
In some instances this home is for only one short
season, when the two part, probably forever; but
in other cases the choice is for life.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>But if his rival is stronger, handsomer, and&mdash;victorious,
what then? Alas, the song dies in his
throat, plumes hang crestfallen, and the disconsolate
creature must creep about through tangles
and brush, watching from a distance the nest-building,
the delights of home life which fate has
forbidden. But the poor bachelor need not by
any means lose hope; for on all sides dangers
threaten his happy rival&mdash;cats, snakes, jays,
hawks, owls, and boys. Hundreds of birds must
pay for their victory with their lives, and then the
once discarded suitors are quickly summoned by
the widows; and these step-fathers, no whit
chagrined at playing second fiddle, fill up the
ranks, and work for the young birds as if they
were their own offspring.</p>
<p>There is an unsolved mystery about the tragedies
and comedies that go on every spring.
Usually every female bird has several suitors, of
which one is accepted. When the death of this
mate occurs, within a day or two another is
found; and this may be repeated a dozen times in
succession. Not only this, but when a female bird
is killed, her mate is generally able at once somewhere,
somehow, to find another to take her place.
Why these unmated males and females remain
single until they are needed is something that has
never been explained.</p>
<p>The theme of the courtship of birds is marvellously
varied and comparatively little understood.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
Who would think that when our bald eagle, of
national fame, seeks to win his mate, his ardour
takes the form of an undignified galloping dance,
round and round her from branch to branch!
Hardly less ridiculous&mdash;to our eyes&mdash;is the
elaborate performance of our most common woodpecker,
the flicker, or high-hole. Two or three
male birds scrape and bow and pose and chatter
about the demure female, outrageously undignified
as compared with their usual behaviour. They
do everything save twirl their black moustaches!</p>
<p>In the mating season some birds have beauties
which are ordinarily concealed. Such is the male
ruby-crowned kinglet, garbed in gray and green,
the two sexes identical, except for the scarlet
touch on the crown of the male, which, at courting
time, he raises and expands. Even the iris of
some birds changes and brightens in colour at the
breeding season; while in others there appear
about the base of the bill horny parts, which in a
month or two fall off. The scarlet coat of the
tanager is perhaps solely for attracting and holding
the attention of the female, as before winter
every feather is shed, the new plumage being of
a dull green, like that of its mate and its young.</p>
<p>As mystery confronts us everywhere in nature,
so we confess ourselves baffled when we attempt
to explain the most wonderful of all the attributes
of bird courtship&mdash;song. Birds have notes to call
to one another, to warn of danger, to express
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
anger and fear; but the highest development of
their vocal efforts seems to be devoted to charming
the females. If birds have a love of music,
then there must be a marvellous diversity of taste
among them, ranging all the way from the shrieking,
strident screams of the parrots and macaws
to the tender pathos of the wood pewee and the
hermit thrush.</p>
<p>If birds have not some appreciation of sweet
sounds, then we must consider the many different
songs as mere by-products, excess of vitality
which expresses itself in results, in many cases,
strangely æsthetic and harmonious. A view midway
is indefinable as regards the boundaries
covered by each theory. How much of the peacock&#8217;s
train or of the thrush&#8217;s song is appreciated
by the female? How much is by-product merely?</p>
<p>In these directions a great field lies open to the
student and lover of birds; but however we decide
for ourselves in regard to the exact meaning and
evolution of song, and what use it subserves
among the birds, we all admit the effect and pleasure
it produces in ourselves. A world without the
song of birds is greatly lacking&mdash;such is a desert,
where even the harsh croak of a raven is melody.</p>
<p>Perhaps the reason why the songs of birds give
more lasting pleasure than many other things is
that sound is so wonderfully potent to recall days
and scenes of our past life. Like a sunset, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
vision that a certain song brings is different to
each one of us.</p>
<p>To me, the lament of the wood pewee brings to
mind deep, moist places in the Pennsylvania backwoods;
the crescendo of the oven bird awakens
memories of the oaks of the Orange mountains;
when a loon or an olive-sided flycatcher or a white-throat
calls, the lakes and forests of Nova Scotia
come vividly to mind; the cry of a sea-swallow
makes real again the white beaches of Virginia;
to me a cardinal has in its song the feathery
lagoons of Florida&#8217;s Indian River, while the
shriek of a macaw and its antithesis, the silvery,
interlacing melodies of the solitaire, spell the
farthest <i>barrancas</i> of Mexico, with the vultures
ever circling overhead, and the smoke clouds of
the volcano in the distance.</p>

<a name='TURTLE_TRAITS' id='TURTLE_TRAITS'></a>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
<h2>TURTLE TRAITS</h2>
</div>

<p>A turtle, waddling his solitary way along
some watercourse, attracts little attention
apart from that aroused by his clumsy, grotesque
shape; yet few who look upon him are able to
give offhand even a bare half-dozen facts about
the humble creature. Could they give any information
at all, it would probably be limited to two
or three usages to which his body is put&mdash;such as
soup, mandolin picks, and combs.</p>
<p>In the northeastern part of our own country we
may look for no fewer than eight species of turtles
which are semi-aquatic, living in or near ponds
and streams, while another, the well-known box
tortoise, confines its travels to the uplands and
woods.</p>
<p>There are altogether about two hundred different
kinds of turtles, and they live in all except
the very cold countries of the world. Australia
has the fewest and North and Central America
the greatest number of species. Evolutionists
can tell us little or nothing of the origin of these
creatures, for as far back in geological ages as
they are found fossil (a matter of a little over ten
million years), all are true turtles, not half turtles
and half something else. Crocodiles and alligators,
with their hard leathery coats, come as near
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
to them as do any living creatures, and when we
see a huge snapping turtle come out of the water
and walk about on land, we cannot fail to be
reminded of the fellow with the armoured back.</p>
<p>Turtles are found on the sea and on land, the
marine forms more properly deserving the name
of turtles; tortoises being those living on land or
in fresh water. We shall use the name turtle as
significant of the whole group. The most natural
method of classifying these creatures is by the
way the head and neck are drawn back under the
shell; whether the head is turned to one side, or
drawn straight back, bending the neck into the
letter S shape.</p>
<p>The skull of a turtle is massive, and some have
thick, false roofs on top of the usual brain box.</p>
<p>The &#8220;house&#8221; or shell of a turtle is made up of
separate pieces of bone, a central row along the
back and others arranged around on both sides.
These are really pieces of the skin of the back
changed to bone. Our ribs are directly under the
skin of the back, and if this skin should harden
into a bone-like substance, the ribs would lie flat
against it, and this is the case with the ribs of
turtles. So when we marvel that the ribs of a
turtle are on the outside of its body, a second
thought will show us that this is just as true of
us as it is of these reptiles.</p>
<p>This hardening of the skin has brought about
some interesting changes in the body of the turtle.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
In all the higher animals, from fishes up to man,
a backbone is of the greatest importance not only
in carrying the nerves and blood-vessels, but in
supporting the entire body. In turtles alone, the
string of vertebræ is unnecessary, the shell giving
all the support needed. So, as Nature seldom
allows unused tissues or organs to remain, these
bones along the back become, in many species,
reduced to a mere thread.</p>
<p>The pieces of bone or horn which go to make up
the shell, although so different in appearance from
the skin, yet have the same life-processes. Occasionally
the shell moults or peels, the outer part
coming off in great flakes. Each piece grows by
the addition of rings of horn at the joints, and
(like the rings of a tree) the age of turtles, except
of very old ones, can be estimated by the number
of circles of horn on each piece. The rings are
very distinct in species which live in temperate
climates. Here they are compelled to hibernate
during the winter, and this cessation of growth
marks the intervals between each ring. In tropical
turtles the rings are either absent or indistinct.
It is to this mode of growth that the spreading
of the initials which are cut into the shell is
due, just as letters carved on the trunks of trees
in time broaden and bulge outward.</p>
<p>The shell has the power of regeneration, and
when a portion is crushed or torn away the injured
parts are gradually cast off, and from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
surrounding edges a new covering of horn grows
out. One third of the entire shell has been known
to be thus replaced.</p>
<p>Although so slow in their locomotion and
actions, turtles have well-developed senses. They
can see very distinctly, and the power of smell is
especially acute, certain turtles being very discriminating
in the matter of food. They are also
very sensitive to touch, and will react to the least
tap on their shells. Their hearing, however, is
more imperfect, but as during the mating season
they have tiny, piping voices, this sense must be
of some use.</p>
<p>Water tortoises can remain beneath the surface
for hours and even days at a time. In addition
to the lungs there are two small sacs near the tail
which allow the animal to use the oxygen in the
water as an aid to breathing.</p>
<p>All turtles lay eggs, the shells of which are white
and generally of a parchment-like character. They
are deposited in the ground or in the sand, and
hatch either by the warmth of the decaying vegetation
or by the heat of the sun. In temperate
countries the eggs remain through the winter, and
the little turtles do not emerge until the spring.
The eggs of turtles are very good to eat, and the
oil contained in them is put to many uses. In all
the countries which they inhabit, young turtles
have a hard time of it; for thousands of them are
devoured by storks, alligators, and fishes. Even
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
old turtles have many enemies, not the least
strange being jaguars, which watch for them, turn
them on their backs with a flip of the paw, and
eat them at leisure&mdash;on the half shell, as it were!</p>
<p>Leathery turtles&mdash;which live in the sea&mdash;have
been reported weighing over a thousand pounds!
This species is very rare, and a curious circumstance
is that only very large adults and very
small baby individuals have been seen, the turtles
of all intermediate growths keeping in the deep
ocean out of view.</p>
<p>Snapping turtles are among the fiercest creatures
in the world. On leaving the egg their first
instinct is to open their mouths and bite at something.
They feed on almost anything, but when,
in captivity they sometimes refuse to eat, and
have been known to go a year without food, showing
no apparent ill effects. One method which
they employ in capturing their food is interesting.
A snapping turtle will lie quietly at the bottom of
a pond or lake, looking like an old water-soaked
log with a branch&mdash;its head and neck&mdash;at one end.
From the tip of the tongue the creature extrudes
two small filaments of a pinkish colour which
wriggle about, bearing a perfect resemblance to
the small round worms of which fishes are so fond.
Attracted by these, fishes swim up to grasp the
squirming objects and are engulfed by the cruel
mouth of the angler. Certain marine turtles have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
long-fringed appendages on the head and neck,
which, waving about, serve a similar purpose.</p>
<p>The edible terrapin has, in many places, become
very rare; so that thousands of them are kept and
bred in enclosed areas, or &#8220;crawls,&#8221; as they are
called. This species is noted for its curious disposition,
and it is often captured by being
attracted by some unusual sound.</p>
<p>The tortoise-shell of commerce is obtained from
the shell of the hawksbill turtle, the plates of
which, being very thin, are heated and welded together
until of the required thickness. The age to
which turtles live has often been exaggerated, but
they are certainly the longest lived of all living
creatures. Individuals from the Galapagos Island
are estimated to be over four hundred years
old. When, in a zoological garden, we see one of
these creatures and study his aged, aged look, as
he slowly and deliberately munches the cabbage
which composes his food, we can well believe that
such a being saw the light of day before Columbus
made his memorable voyage.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
<h2>A HALF-HOUR IN A MARSH</h2>
</div>

<p>There are little realms all around of which
many of us know nothing. Take, for
example, some marsh within a half-hour&#8217;s trolley
ride of any of our cities or towns. Select one
where cat-tails and reeds abound. Mosquitoes
and fear of malaria keep these places free from
invasion by humankind; but if we select some
windy day we may laugh them both to scorn, and
we shall be well repaid for our trip. The birds
frequenting these places are so seldom disturbed
that they make only slight effort to conceal their
nests, and we shall find plenty of the beautiful
bird cradles rocking with every passing breeze.</p>
<p>A windy day will also reveal an interesting
feature of the marsh. The soft, velvety grass,
which abounds in such places, is so pliant and
yielding that it responds to every breath, and each
approaching wave of air is heralded by an advancing
curl of the grass. At our feet these grass-waves
intersect and recede, giving a weird sensation,
as if the ground were moving, or as if we
were walking on the water itself. Where the
grass is longer, the record of some furious gale is
permanently fixed&mdash;swaths and ripples seeming
to roll onward, or to break into green foam. The
simile of a &#8220;painted ocean&#8221; is perfectly carried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
out. There is no other substance, not even sand,
which simulates more exactly the motions of water
than this grass.</p>
<p>In the nearest clump of reeds we notice several
red-winged blackbirds, chattering nervously. A
magnificent male bird, black as night, and with
scarlet epaulets burning on his shoulders, swoops
at us, while his inconspicuous brownish consorts
vibrate above the reeds, some with grubs, some
empty mouthed. They are invariable indexes of
what is below them. We may say with perfect
assurance that in that patch of rushes are two
nests, one with young; beyond are three others,
all with eggs.</p>
<p>We find beautiful structures, firm and round,
woven of coarse grasses inside and dried reeds
without, hung between two or three supporting
stalks, or, if it is a fresh-water marsh, sheltered
by long, green fern fronds. The eggs are worthy
of their cradles&mdash;pearly white in colour, with
scrawls and blotches of dark purple at the larger
end&mdash;hieroglyphics which only the blackbirds can
translate.</p>
<p>In another nest we find newly hatched young,
looking like large strawberries, their little naked
bodies of a vivid orange colour, with scanty gray
tufts of down here and there. Not far away is a
nest, overflowing with five young birds ready to
fly, which scramble out at our approach and start
boldly off; but as their weak wings give out, they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
soon come to grief. We catch one and find that
it has most delicate colours, resembling its mother
in being striped brown and black, although its
breast and under parts are of an unusually beautiful
tint&mdash;a kind of salmon pink. I never saw this
shade elsewhere in Nature.</p>
<p>Blackbirds are social creatures, and where we
find one nest, four or five others may be looked for
near by. The red-winged blackbird is a mormon
in very fact, and often a solitary male bird may
be seen guarding a colony of three or four nests,
each with an attending female. A sentiment of
altruism seems indeed not unknown, as I have
seen a female give a grub to one of a hungry nestful,
before passing on to brood her own eggs, yet
unhatched.</p>
<p>While looking for the blackbirds&#8217; nests we shall
come across numerous round, or oval, masses of
dried weeds and grass&mdash;mice homes we may think
them; and the small, winding entrance concealed
on one side tends to confirm this opinion. Several
will be empty, but when in one our fingers touch
six or eight tiny eggs, our mistake will be apparent.
Long-billed marsh wrens are the architects,
and so fond are they of building that frequently
three or four unused nests are constructed before
the little chocolate jewels are deposited.</p>
<p>If we sit quietly for a few moments, one of the
owners, overcome by wren curiosity, will appear,
clinging to a reed stalk and twitching his pert,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
upturned tail, the badge of his family. Soon he
springs up into the air and, bubbling a jumble of
liquid notes, sinks back into the recesses of the
cat-tails. Another and another repeat this until
the marsh rings with their little melodies.</p>
<p>If we seat ourselves and watch quietly we may
possibly behold an episode that is not unusual.
The joyous songs of the little wrens suddenly give
place to cries of fear and anger; and this hubbub
increases until at last we see a sinister ripple
flowing through the reeds, marking the advancing
head of a water snake.</p>
<p>The evil eyes of the serpent are bent upon the
nearest nest, and toward it he makes his way, followed
and beset by all the wrens in the vicinity.
Slowly the scaly creature pushes himself up on
the reeds; and as they bend under his weight he
makes his way the more easily along them to the
nest. His head is pushed in at the entrance, but
an instant later the snake twines downward to the
water. The nest was empty. Again he seeks an
adjoining nest, and again is disappointed; and
now, a small fish attracting his attention, he goes
off in swift pursuit, leaving untouched the third
nest in sight, that containing the precious eggs.
Thus the apparently useless industry of the tiny
wrens has served an invaluable end, and the
tremulous chorus is again timidly taken up&mdash;little
hymns of thanksgiving we may imagine them now.</p>
<p>These and many others are sights which a half-hour&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
tramp, without even wetting our shoes,
may show us. Before we leave, hints of more
deeply hidden secrets of the marsh may perhaps
come to us. A swamp sparrow may show by its
actions that its nest is not far away; from the
depths of a ditch jungle the clatter of some rail
comes faintly to our ears, and the distant croak
of a night heron reaches us from its feeding-grounds,
guarded by the deeper waters.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
<h2>SECRETS OF THE OCEAN</h2>
</div>

<p>We are often held spellbound by the majesty
of mountains, and indeed a lofty peak
forever capped with snow, or pouring forth smoke
and ashes, is impressive beyond all terrestrial
things. But the ocean yields to nothing in its
grandeur, in its age, in its ceaseless movement,
and the question remains forever unanswered,
&#8220;Who shall sound the mysteries of the sea?&#8221;
Before the most ancient of mountains rose from
the heart of the earth, the waves of the sea rolled
as now, and though the edges of the continents
shrink and expand, bend into bays or stretch out
into capes, always through all the ages the sea
follows and laps with ripples or booms with
breakers unceasingly upon the shore.</p>
<p>Whether considered from the standpoint of the
scientist, the mere curiosity of the tourist, or the
keen delight of the enthusiastic lover of Nature,
the shore of the sea&mdash;its sands and waters, its
ever-changing skies and moods&mdash;is one of the most
interesting spots in the world. The very bottom
of the deep bays near shore&mdash;dark and eternally
silent, prisoned under the restless waste of waters&mdash;is
thickly carpeted with strange and many-coloured
forms of animal and vegetable life. But
the beaches and tide-pools over which the moon-urged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
tides hold sway in their ceaseless rise and
fall, teem with marvels of Nature&#8217;s handiwork,
and every day are restocked and replanted with
new living objects, both arctic and tropical offerings
of each heaving tidal pulse.</p>
<p>Here on the northeastern shores of our continent
one may spend days of leisure or delightful
study among the abundant and ever changing
variety of wonderful living creatures. It is not
unlikely that the enjoyment and absolute novelty
of this new world may enable one to look on these
as some of the most pleasant days of life. I write
from the edge of the restless waters of Fundy, but
any rock-strewn shore will duplicate the marvels.</p>
<p>At high tide the surface of the Bay is unbroken
by rock or shoal, and stretches glittering in the
sunlight from the beach at one&#8217;s feet to where the
New Brunswick shore is just visible, appearing
like a low bluish cloud on the horizon. At times
the opposite shore is apparently brought nearer
and made more distinct by a mirage, which inverts
it, together with any ships which are in sight. A
brig may be seen sailing along keel upward, in the
most matter-of-fact way. The surface may anon
be torn by those fearful squalls for which Fundy
is noted, or, calm as a mirror, reflect the blue sky
with an added greenish tinge, troubled only by
the gentle alighting of a gull, the splash of a kingfisher
or occasional osprey, as these dive for their
prey, or the ruffling which shows where a school
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
of mackerel is passing. This latter sign always
sends the little sailing dories hurrying out, where
they beat back and forth, like shuttles travelling
across a loom, and at each turn a silvery struggling
form is dragged into the boat.</p>
<p>A little distance along the shore the sandy beach
ends and is replaced by huge bare boulders, scattered
and piled in the utmost confusion. Back of
these are scraggly spruces, with branches which
have been so long blown landwards that they have
bent and grown altogether on that side,&mdash;permanent
weather-vanes of Fundy&#8217;s storms. The very
soil in which they began life was blown away, and
their gnarled weather-worn roots hug the rocks,
clutching every crevice as a drowning man would
grasp an oar. On the side away from the bay two
or three long, thick roots stretch far from each
tree to the nearest earth-filled gully, sucking what
scanty nourishment they can, for strength to withstand
the winter&#8217;s gales yet another year or decade.
Beach-pea and sweet marsh lavender tint
the sand, and stunted fringed orchids gleam in the
coarse grass farther inland. High up among the
rocks, where there is scarcely a handful of soil,
delicate harebells sway and defy the blasts, enduring
because of their very pliancy and weakness.</p>
<p>If we watch awhile we will see a line of blackish
seaweed and wet sand appearing along the edge of
the water, showing that the tide has turned and
begun to recede. In an hour it has ebbed a considerable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
distance, and if we clamber down over
the great weather-worn rocks the hardy advance
guard of that wonderful world of life under the
water is seen. Barnacles whiten the top of every
rock which is reached by the tide, although the
water may cover them only a short time each day.
But they flourish here in myriads, and the shorter
the chance they have at the salt water the more
frantically their little feathery feet clutch at the
tiny food particles which float around them. These
thousands of tiny turreted castles are built so
closely together that many are pressed out of
shape, paralleling in shape as in substance the
inorganic crystals of the mineral kingdom. The
valved doors are continually opening and partly
closing, and if we listen quietly we can hear a perpetual
shuss! shuss! Is it the creaking of the tiny
hinges? As the last receding wave splashes them,
they shut their folding doors over a drop or two
and remain tightly closed, while perhaps ten hours
of sunlight bake them, or they glisten in the moonlight
for the same length of time, ready at the first
touch of the returning water to open wide and
welcome it.</p>
<p>The thought of their life history brings to mind
how sadly they retrogress as they grow, hatching
as minute free-swimming creatures like tiny lobsters,
and gradually changing to this plant-like
life, <i>sans</i> eyes, <i>sans</i> head, <i>sans</i> most everything
except a stomach and a few pairs of feathery feet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
to kick food into it. A few pitiful traces of nerves
are left them. What if there were enough ganglia
to enable them to dream of their past higher
life, in the long intervals of patient waiting!</p>
<p>A little lower down we come to the zone of mussels,&mdash;hanging
in clusters like some strange sea-fruit.
Each is attached by strands of thin silky
cables, so tough that they often defy our utmost
efforts to tear a specimen away. How secure these
creatures seem, how safe from all harm, and yet
they have enemies which make havoc among them.
At high tide fishes come and crunch them, shells
and all, and multitudes of carnivorous snails are
waiting to set their file-like tongues at work, which
mercilessly drill through the lime shells, bringing
death in a more subtle but no less certain
form. Storms may tear away the support of these
poor mollusks, and the waves dash them far out of
the reach of the tides, while at low water, crows
and gulls use all their ingenuity to get at their
toothsome flesh.</p>
<p>There are no ant-hills in the sea, but when we
turn over a large stone and see scores upon scores
of small black shrimps scurrying around, the
resemblance to those insects is striking. These
little creatures quickly hitch away on their sides,
getting out of sight in a remarkably short time.</p>
<p>The tide is going down rapidly, and following it
step by step novel sights meet the eye at every
turn, and we begin to realise that in this narrow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
strip, claimed alternately by sea and land, which
would be represented on a map by the finest of
hair-lines, there exists a complete world of animated
life, comparing in variety and numbers
with the life in that thinner medium, air. We
climb over enormous boulders, so different in appearance
that they would never be thought to consist
of the same material as those higher up on
the shore. These are masses of wave-worn rock,
twenty or thirty feet across, piled in every imaginable
position, and completely covered with a
thick padding of seaweed. Their drapery of algæ
hangs in festoons, and if we draw aside these submarine
curtains, scenes from a veritable fairyland
are disclosed. Deep pools of water, clear as
crystal and icy cold, contain creatures both hideous
and beautiful, sombre and iridescent, formless
and of exquisite shape.</p>
<p>The sea-anemones first attract attention, showing
as splashes of scarlet and salmon among the
olive-green seaweed, or in hundreds covering the
entire bottom of a pool with a delicately hued mist
of waving tentacles. As the water leaves these
exposed on the walls of the caves, they lose their
plump appearance and, drawing in their wreath
of tentacles, hang limp and shrivelled, resembling
pieces of water-soaked meat as much as anything.
Submerged in the icy water they are veritable
animal-flowers. Their beauty is indeed well
guarded, hidden by the overhanging seaweed in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
these caves twenty-five feet or more below high-water
mark.</p>
<p>Here in these beautiful caverns we may make
aquariums, and transplant as many animal-flowers
as we wish. Wherever we place them their fleshy,
snail-like foot spreads out, takes tight hold, and
the creature lives content, patiently waiting for
the Providence of the sea to send food to its many
wide-spread fingers.</p>
<p>Carpeted with pink algæ and dainty sponges,
draped with sea-lettuce like green tissue paper,
decorated with strange corallines, these natural
aquariums far surpass any of artificial make. Although
the tide drives us from them sooner or
later, we may return with the sure prospect of
finding them refreshed and perhaps replenished
with many new forms. For often some of the
deep-water creatures are held prisoners in the
lower tide-pools, as the water settles, somewhat as
when the glaciers receded northward after the Ice
Age there were left on isolated mountain peaks
traces of the boreal fauna and flora.</p>
<p>If we are interested enough to watch our
anemones we will find much entertainment. Let
us return to our shrimp colonies and bring a handful
to our pool. Drop one in the centre of an
anemone and see how quickly it contracts. The
tentacles bend over it exactly as the sticky hairs
of the sun-dew plant close over a fly. The shrimp
struggles for a moment and is then drawn downward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
out of sight. The birth of an anemone is
well worth patient watching, and this may take
place in several different ways. We may see a
large individual with a number of tiny bunches
on the sides of the body, and if we keep this one
in a tumbler, before long these protuberances will
be seen to develop a few tentacles and at last
break off as perfect miniature anemones. Or
again, an anemone may draw in its tentacles without
apparent cause, and after a few minutes expand
more widely than ever. Suddenly a movement
of the mouth is seen, and it opens, and one,
two, or even a half-dozen tiny anemones shoot
forth. They turn and roll in the little spurt of
water and gradually settle to the rock alongside
of the mother. In a short time they turn right
side up, expand their absurd little heads, and
begin life for themselves. These animal &#8220;buds&#8221;
may be of all sizes; some minute ones will be much
less developed and look very unlike the parent.
These are able to swim about for a while, and
myriads of them may be born in an hour. Others,
as we have seen, have tentacles and settle down
at once.</p>
<p>Fishes, little and big, are abundant in the pools,
darting here and there among the leathery fronds
of &#8220;devils&#8217; aprons,&#8221; cavernous-mouthed angler
fish, roly-poly young lump-suckers, lithe butterfish,
and many others.</p>
<p>Moving slowly through the pools are many
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
beautiful creatures, some so evanescent that they
are only discoverable by the faint shadows which
they cast on the bottom, others suggest animated
spheres of prismatic sunlight. These latter are
tiny jelly-fish, circular hyaline masses of jelly with
eight longitudinal bands, composed of many
comb-like plates, along which iridescent waves of
light continually play. The graceful appearance
of these exquisite creatures is increased by two
long, fringed tentacles streaming behind, drifting
at full length or contracting into numerous coils.
The fringe on these streamers is a series of living
hairs&mdash;an aquatic cobweb, each active with life,
and doing its share in ensnaring minute atoms of
food for its owner. When dozens of these
<i>ctenophores</i> (or comb-bearers) as they are called,
glide slowly to and fro through a pool, the sight is
not soon forgotten. To try to photograph them
is like attempting to portray the substance of a
sunbeam, but patience works wonders, and even a
slightly magnified image of a living jelly is
secured, which shows very distinctly all the details
of its wonderfully simple structure; the
pouch, suspended in the centre of the sphere,
which does duty as a stomach; the sheaths into
which the long tentacles may be so magically
packed, and the tiny organ at the top of this living
ball of spun glass, serving, with its minute weights
and springs, as compass, rudder, and pilot to this
little creature, which does not fear to pit its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
muscles of jelly against the rush and might of
breaking waves.</p>
<p>Even the individual comb-plates or rows of oars
are plainly seen, although, owing to their rapid
motion, they appear to the naked eye as a single
band of scintillating light. This and other magnified
photographs were obtained by fastening the
lens of a discarded bicycle lantern in a cone of
paper blackened on the inside with shoe-blacking.
With this crude apparatus placed in front of the
lens of the camera, the evanescent beauties of
these most delicate creatures were preserved.</p>
<p>Other equally beautiful forms of jelly-fish are
balloon-shaped. These are <i>Beröe</i>, fitly named
after the daughter of the old god Oceanus. They,
like others of their family, pulsate through the
water, sweeping gracefully along, borne on currents
of their own making.</p>
<p>Passing to other inhabitants of the pools, we
find starfish and sea-urchins everywhere abundant.
Hunched-up groups of the former show
where they are dining in their unique way on unfortunate
sea-snails or anemones, protruding
their whole stomach and thus engulfing their victim.
The urchins strain and stretch with their
innumerable sucker-feet, feeling for something to
grasp, and in this laborious way pull themselves
along. The mouth, with the five so-called teeth,
is a conspicuous feature, visible at the centre of
the urchin and surrounded by the greenish spines.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
Some of the starfish are covered with long spines,
others are nearly smooth. The colours are wonderfully
varied,&mdash;red, purple, orange, yellow, etc.</p>
<p>The stages through which these prickly skinned
animals pass, before they reach the adult state,
are wonderfully curious, and only when they are
seen under the microscope can they be fully appreciated.
A bolting-cloth net drawn through
some of the pools will yield thousands in many
stages, and we can take eggs of the common starfish
and watch their growth in tumblers of water.
At first the egg seems nothing but a tiny round
globule of jelly, but soon a dent or depression
appears on one side, which becomes deeper and
deeper until it extends to the centre of the egg-mass.
It is as if we should take a round ball of
putty and gradually press our finger into it. This
pressed-in sac is a kind of primitive stomach and
the entrance is used as a mouth. After this follows
a marvellous succession of changes, form
giving place to form, differing more in appearance
and structure from the five-armed starfish
than a caterpillar differs from a butterfly.</p>
<p>For example, when about eight days old,
another mouth has formed and two series of delicate
cilia or swimming hairs wind around the
creature, by means of which it glides slowly
through the water. The photographs of a starfish
of this age show the stomach with its contents, a
dark rounded mass near the lower portion of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
organism. The vibrating bands which outline the
tiny animal are also visible. The delicacy of structure
and difficulty of preserving these young starfish
alive make these pictures of particular value,
especially as they were taken of the living forms
swimming in their natural element. Each day
and almost each hour adds to the complexity of
the little animal, lung tentacles grow out and
many other larval stages are passed through
before the starfish shape is discernible within this
curious &#8220;nurse&#8221; or living, changing egg. Then
the entire mass, so elaborately evolved through
so long a time, is absorbed and the little baby star
sinks to the bottom to start on its new life, crawling
around and over whatever happens in its path
and feeding to repletion on succulent oysters. It
can laugh at the rage of the oysterman, who
angrily tears it in pieces, for &#8220;time heals all
wounds&#8221; literally in the case of these creatures,
and even if the five arms are torn apart, five starfish,
small of arm but with healthy stomachs, will
soon be foraging on the oyster bed.</p>
<p>But to return to our tide-pools. In the skimming
net with the young starfish many other creatures
are found, some so delicate and fragile that
they disintegrate before microscope and camera
can be placed in position. I lie at full length on
a soft couch of seaweed with my face close to a
tiny pool no larger than my hand. A few armadillo
shells and limpets crawl on the bottom, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
a frequent troubling of the water baffles me. I
make sure my breath has nothing to do with it,
but still it continues. At last a beam of sunshine
lights up the pool, and as if a film had rolled from
my eyes I see the cause of the disturbance. A sea-worm&mdash;or
a ghost of one&mdash;is swimming about. Its
large, brilliant eyes, long tentacles, and innumerable
waving appendages are now as distinct as
before they had been invisible. A trifling change
in my position and all vanishes as if by magic.
There seems not an organ, not a single part of
the creature, which is not as transparent as the
water itself. The fine streamers into which the
paddles and gills are divided are too delicate to
have existence in any but a water creature, and
the least attempt to lift the animal from its element
would only tear and dismember it, so I leave
it in the pool to await the return of the tide.</p>
<p>Shrimps and prawns of many shapes and colours
inhabit every pool. One small species,
abundant on the algæ, combines the colour changes
of a chameleon with the form and manner of
travel of a measuring-worm, looping along the
fronds of seaweed or swimming with the same
motion. Another variety of shrimp resembles
the common wood-louse found under pieces of
bark, but is most beautifully iridescent, glowing
like an opal at the bottom of the pool. The curious
little sea-spiders keep me guessing for a long
time where their internal organs can be, as they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
consist of legs with merely enough body to connect
these firmly together. The fact that the
thread-like stomach and other organs send a
branch into each of the eight legs explains the
mystery and shows how far economy of space may
go. Their skeleton-forms, having the appearance
of eight straggling filaments of seaweed, are thus,
doubtless, a great protection to these creatures
from their many enemies. Other hobgoblin forms
with huge probosces crawl slowly over the floors
of the anemone caves, or crouch as the shadow of
my hand or net falls upon them.</p>
<p>The larger gorgeously coloured and graceful
sea-worms contribute not a small share to the
beauty of Fundy tide-pools, swimming in iridescent
waves through the water or waving their
Medusa-head of crimson tentacles at the bottom
among the sea-lettuce. These worms form tubes
of mud for themselves, and the rows of hooks on
each side of the body enable them to climb up and
down in their dismal homes.</p>
<p>Much of the seaweed from deeper bottoms
seems to be covered with a dense fur, which under
a hand lens resolves into beautiful hydroids,&mdash;near
relatives of the anemones and corals.
Scientists have happily given these most euphonious
names&mdash;<i>Campanularia</i>, <i>Obelia</i>, and <i>Plumularia</i>.
Among the branches of certain of these,
numbers of round discs or spheres are visible.
These are young medusæ or jelly-fish, which grow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
like bunches of currants, and later will break off
and swim around at pleasure in the water. Occasionally
one is fortunate enough to discover these
small jellies in a pool where they can be photographed
as they pulsate back and forth. When
these attain their full size they lay eggs which
sink to the bottom and grow up into the plant-like
hydroids. So each generation of these interesting
creatures is entirely unlike that which immediately
precedes or follows it. In other words, a
hydroid is exactly like its grandmother and granddaughter,
but as different from its parents and
children in appearance as a plant is from an animal.
Even in a fairy-story book this would be
wonderful, but here it is taking place under our
very eyes, as are scores of other transformations
and &#8220;miracles in miniature&#8221; in this marvellous
underworld.</p>
<p>Now let us deliberately pass by all the attractions
of the middle zone of tide-pools and on as
far as the lowest level of the water will admit.
We are far out from the shore and many feet
below the level of the barnacle-covered boulders
over which we first clambered. Now we may
indeed be prepared for strange sights, for we are
on the very borderland of the vast unknown. The
abyss in front of us is like planetary space, unknown
to the feet of man. While we know the latter
by scant glimpses through our telescopes, the
former has only been scratched by the hauls of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
the dredge, the mark of whose iron shoe is like the
tiny track of a snail on the leaf mould of a vast
forest.</p>
<p>The first plunge beneath the icy waters of
Fundy is likely to remain long in one&#8217;s memory,
and one&#8217;s first dive of short duration, but the
glimpse which is had and the hastily snatched
handfuls of specimens of the beauties which no
tide ever uncovers is potent to make one forget
his shivering and again and again seek to penetrate
as far as a good-sized stone and a lungful
of air will carry him. Strange sensations are experienced
in these aquatic scrambles. It takes a
long time to get used to pulling oneself <i>downward</i>,
or propping your knees against the <i>under</i> crevices
of rocks. To all intents and purposes, the law of
gravitation is partly suspended, and when stone
and wooden wedge accidentally slip from one&#8217;s
hand and disappear in <i>opposite</i> directions, it is
confusing, to say the least.</p>
<p>When working in one spot for some time the
fishes seem to become used to one, and approach
quite closely. Slick-looking pollock, bloated lump-fish,
and occasionally a sombre dog-fish rolls by,
giving one a start, as the memory of pictures of
battles between divers and sharks of tropical waters
comes to mind. One&#8217;s mental impressions
made thus are somewhat disconnected. With the
blood buzzing in the ears, it is only possible to
snatch general glimpses and superficial details.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
Then at the surface, notes can be made, and specimens
which have been overlooked, felt for during
the next trip beneath the surface. Fronds of
laminaria yards in length, like sheets of rubber,
offer convenient holds, and at their roots many
curious creatures make their home. Serpent starfish,
agile as insects and very brittle, are abundant,
and new forms of worms, like great slugs,&mdash;their
backs covered with gills in the form of tufted
branches.</p>
<p>In these outer, eternally submerged regions are
starfish of still other shapes, some with a dozen
or more arms. I took one with thirteen rays and
placed it temporarily in a pool aquarium with
some large anemones. On returning in an hour
or two I found the starfish trying to make a meal
of the largest anemone. Hundreds of dart-covered
strings had been pushed out by the latter in defence,
but they seemed to cause the starfish no
inconvenience whatever.</p>
<p>In my submarine glimpses I saw spaces free
from seaweed on which hundreds of tall polyps
were growing, some singly, others in small tufts.
The solitary individuals rise three or four inches
by a nearly straight stalk, surmounted by a many-tentacled
head. This droops gracefully to one
side and the general effect is that of a bed of
rose-coloured flowers. From the heads hang
grape-like masses, which on examination in a
tumbler are seen to be immature medusæ. Each
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
of these develop to the point where the four radiating
canals are discernible and then their growth
comes to a standstill, and they never attain the
freedom for which their structure fits them.</p>
<p>When the wind blew inshore, I would often find
the water fairly alive with large sun-jellies or
<i>Aurelia</i>,&mdash;their Latin name. Their great milky-white
bodies would come heaving along and bump
against me, giving a very &#8220;crawly&#8221; sensation.
The circle of short tentacles and the four horse-shoe-shaped
ovaries distinguish this jelly-fish
from all others. When I had gone down as far
as I dared, I would sometimes catch glimpses of
these strange beings far below me, passing and
repassing in the silence and icy coldness of the
watery depths. These large medusæ are often
very abundant after a favourable wind has blown
for a few days, and I have rowed through masses
of them so thick that it seemed like rowing through
thick jelly, two or three feet deep. In an area the
length of the boat and about a yard wide, I have
counted over one hundred and fifty <i>Aurelias</i> on
the surface alone.</p>
<p>When one of these &#8220;sunfish,&#8221; as the fishermen
call them, is lifted from the water, the clay-coloured
eggs may be seen to stream from it in
myriads. In many jellies, small bodies the size of
a pea are visible in the interior of the mass, and
when extracted they prove to be a species of small
shrimp. These are well adapted for their quasi-parasitic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
life, in colour being throughout of the
same milky semi-opaqueness as their host, but one
very curious thing about them is, that when taken
out and placed in some water in a vial or tumbler
they begin to turn darker almost immediately, and
in five minutes all will be of various shades, from
red to a dark brown.</p>
<p>I had no fear of <i>Aurelia</i>, but when another free-swimming
species of jelly-fish, <i>Cyanea</i>, or the
blue-jelly, appeared, I swam ashore with all speed.
This great jelly is usually more of a reddish liver-colour
than a purple, and is much to be dreaded.
Its tentacles are of enormous length. I have seen
specimens which measured two feet across the
disc, with streamers fully forty feet long, and one
has been recorded seven feet across and no less
than one hundred and twelve feet to the tip of the
cruel tentacles! These trail behind in eight
bunches and form a living, tangled labyrinth as
deadly as the hair of the fabled Medusa&mdash;whose
name indeed has been so appropriately applied to
this division of animals. The touch of each tentacle
to the skin is like a lash of nettle, and there
would be little hope for a diver whose path crossed
such a fiery tangle. The untold myriads of little
darts which are shot out secrete a poison which is
terribly irritating.</p>
<p>On the crevice bottoms a sight now and then
meets my eyes which brings the &#8220;devil-fish&#8221; of
Victor Hugo&#8217;s romance vividly to mind,&mdash;a misshapen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
squid making its way snakily over the
shells and seaweed. Its large eyes gaze fixedly
around and the arms reach alternately forward,
the sucking cups lined with their cruel teeth closing
over the inequalities of the bottom. The creature
may suddenly change its mode of progression
and shoot like an arrow, backward and upward.
If we watch one in its passage over areas of seaweed
and sand, a wonderful adaptation becomes
apparent. Its colour changes continually; when
near sand it is of a sombre brown hue, then blushes
of colour pass over it and the tint changes, corresponding
to the seaweed or patches of pink sponge
over which it swims. The way in which this is
accomplished is very ingenious and loses nothing
by examination. Beneath the skin are numerous
cells filled with liquid pigment. When at rest
these contract until they are almost invisible, appearing
as very small specks or dots on the surface
of the body. When the animal wishes to
change its hue, certain muscles which radiate from
these colour cells are shortened, drawing the cells
out in all directions until they seem confluent. It
is as if the freckles on a person&#8217;s face should be
all joined together, when an ordinary tan would
result.</p>
<p>From bottoms ten to twenty fathoms below the
surface, deeper than mortal eye can probably ever
hope to reach, the dredge brings up all manner of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
curious things; basket starfish, with arms divided
and subdivided into many tendrils, on the tips of
which it walks, the remaining part converging upward
like the trellis of a vine-covered summer
house. Sponges of many hues must fairly carpet
large areas of the deep water, as the dredge is
often loaded with them. The small shore-loving
ones which I photographed are in perfect health,
but the camera cannot show the many tiny currents
of water pouring in food and oxygen at the
smaller openings, and returning in larger streams
from the tall funnels on the surface of the sponge,
which a pinch of carmine dust reveals so beautifully.
From the deeper aquatic gardens come up
great orange and yellow sponges, two and three
feet in length, and around the bases of these the
weird serpent stars are clinging, while crabs
scurry away as the mass reaches the surface of
the water.</p>
<p>Treasures from depths of forty and even fifty
fathoms can be obtained when a trip is taken with
the trawl-men. One can sit fascinated for hours,
watching the hundreds of yards of line reel in,
with some interesting creature on each of the
thirty-seven hundred odd hooks. At times a
glance down into the clear water will show a score
of fish in sight at once, hake, haddock, cod, halibut,
dog-fish, and perhaps an immense &#8220;barndoor&#8221;
skate, a yard or more square. This latter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
hold back with frantic flaps of its great
&#8220;wings,&#8221; and tax all the strength of the sturdy
Acadian fishermen to pull it to the gunwale.</p>
<p>Now and then a huge &#8220;meat-rock,&#8221; the fishermen&#8217;s
apt name for an anemone, comes up, impaled
on a hook, and still clinging to a stone of five
to ten pounds weight. These gigantic scarlet ones
from full fifty fathoms far surpass any near shore.
Occasionally the head alone of a large fish will
appear, with the entire body bitten clean off, a
hint of the monsters which must haunt the lower
depths. The pressure of the air must be excessive,
for many of the fishes have their swimming
bladders fairly forced out of their mouths by the
lessening of atmospheric pressure as they are
drawn to the surface. When a basket starfish
finds one of the baits in that sunless void far beneath
our boat, he hugs it so tenaciously that the
upward jerks of the reel only make him hold the
more tightly.</p>
<p>Once in a great while the fishermen find what
they call a &#8220;knob-fish&#8221; on one of their hooks, and
I never knew what they meant until one day a
small colony of five was brought ashore. <i>Boltenia</i>,
the scientists call them, tall, queer-shaped things;
a stalk six to eight inches in length, with a knob
or oblong bulb-like body at the summit, looking
exactly like the flower of a lady-slipper orchid and
as delicately coloured. This is a member of that
curious family of Ascidians, which forever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
trembles in the balance between the higher backboned
animals and the lower division, where are
classified the humbler insects, crabs, and snails.
The young of <i>Boltenia</i> promises everything in its
tiny backbone or notochord, but it all ends in
promise, for that shadow of a great ambition
withers away, and the creature is doomed to a
lowly and vegetative life. If we soften the hard
scientific facts which tell us of these dumb, blind
creatures, with the humane mellowing thought of
the oneness of all life, we will find much that is
pathetic and affecting in their humble biographies
from our point of view. And yet these cases of
degeneration are far from anything like actual
misfortunes, or mishaps of nature, as Buffon was
so fond of thinking. These creatures have found
their adult mode of life more free from competition
than any other, and hence their adoption of
it. It is only another instance of exquisite adaptation
to an unfilled niche in the life of the world.</p>
<p>Yet another phase of enjoying the life of these
northern waters; the one which comes after all
the work and play of collecting is over for the
day, after the last specimen is given a fresh supply
of water for the night, and the final note in our
journal is written. Then, as dusk falls, we make
our way to the beach, ship our rudder and oars
and push slowly along shore, or drift quietly with
the tide. The stars may come out in clear splendour
and the visual symphony of the northern
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
lights play over the dark vault above us, or all
may be obscured in lowering, leaden clouds. But
the lights of the sea are never obscured&mdash;they
always shine with a splendour which keeps one
entranced for hours.</p>
<p>At night the ripples and foam of the Fundy
shores seem transformed to molten silver and
gold, and after each receding wave the emerald
seaweed is left dripping with millions of sparkling
lights, shining with a living lustre which
would pale the brightest gem. Each of these
countless sparks is a tiny animal, as perfect in its
substance and as well adapted to its cycle of life
as the highest created being. The wonderful way
in which this phosphorescence permeates everything&mdash;the
jelly-fish seeming elfish fireworks as
they throb through the water with rhythmic beats&mdash;the
fish brilliantly lighted up and plainly visible
as they dart about far beneath the surface&mdash;makes
such a night on the Bay of Fundy an experience
to be always remembered.</p>

<h2>BIRDS IN A CITY</h2>
</div>

<p>We frequently hear people say that if only
they lived in the country they would take
up the study of birds with great interest, but that
a city life prevented any nature study. To show
how untrue this is, I once made a census of wild
birds which were nesting in the New York
Zoological Park, which is situated within the
limits of New York City. Part of the Park is
wooded, while much space is given up to the collections
of birds and animals. Throughout the
year thousands of people crowd the walks and
penetrate to every portion of the grounds; yet in
spite of this lack of seclusion no fewer than sixty-one
species build their nests here and successfully
rear their young. The list was made without
shooting a single bird and in each instance the
identification was absolute. This shows what a
little protection will accomplish, while many
places of equal area in the country which are harried
by boys and cats are tenanted by a bare
dozen species.</p>
<p>Let us see what a walk in late June, or especially
in July, will show of these bold invaders of
our very city. Wild wood ducks frequently decoy
to the flocks of pinioned birds and sometimes mate
with some of them. One year a wild bird chose as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
its mate a little brown female, a pinioned bird, and
refused to desert her even when the brood of summer
ducklings was being caught and pinioned.
Such devotion is rare indeed.</p>
<p>In the top of one of the most inaccessible trees
in the Park a great rough nest of sticks shows
where a pair of black-crowned night herons have
made their home for years, and from the pale
green eggs hatch the most awkward of nestling
herons, which squawk and grow to their prime, on
a diet of small fish. When they are able to fly
they pay frequent visits to their relations in the
great flying cage, perching on the top and gazing
with longing eyes at the abundant feasts of fish
which are daily brought by the keepers to their
charges. This duck and heron are the only ones
of their orders thus to honour the Park by nesting,
although a number of other species are not uncommon
during the season of migration.</p>
<p>Of the waders which in the spring and fall
teeter along the bank of the Bronx River, only a
pair or two of spotted sandpipers remain throughout
the nesting period, content to lay their eggs
in some retired spot in the corner of a field, where
there is the least danger to them and to the fluffy
balls of long-legged down which later appear and
scurry about. The great horned owl and the red-tailed
hawk formerly nested in the park, but the
frequent noise of blasting and the building operations
have driven them to more isolated places,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
and of their relatives there remain only the little
screech owls and the sparrow hawks. The latter
feed chiefly upon English sparrows and hence are
worthy of the most careful protection.</p>
<p>These birds should be encouraged to build near
our homes, and if not killed or driven away sometimes
choose the eaves of our houses as their domiciles
and thus, by invading the very haunts of the
sparrows, they would speedily lessen their numbers.
A brood of five young hawks was recently
taken from a nest under the eaves of a school-house
in this city. I immediately took this as a
text addressed to the pupils, and the principal
was surprised to learn that these birds were so
valuable. In the Park the sparrow hawks nest in
a hollow tree, as do the screech owls.</p>
<p>Other most valuable birds which nest in the
Park are the black-billed and yellow-billed
cuckoos, whose depredations among the hairy and
spiny caterpillars should arouse our gratitude.
For these insects are refused by almost all other
birds, and were it not for these slim, graceful creatures
they would increase to prodigious numbers.
Their two or three light blue eggs are always laid
on the frailest of frail platforms made of a few
sticks. The belted kingfisher bores into the bank
of the river and rears his family of six or eight in
the dark, ill-odoured chamber at the end. Young
cuckoos and kingfishers are the quaintest of young
birds. Their plumage does not come out a little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
at a time, as in other nestlings, but the sheaths
which surround the growing feathers remain until
they are an inch or more in length; then one day,
in the space of only an hour or so, the overlapping
armour of bluish tiles bursts and the plumage
assumes a normal appearance.</p>
<p>The little black-and-white downy and the flicker
are the two woodpeckers which make the Park
their home. Both nest in hollows bored out by
their strong beaks, but although full of splinters
and sawdust, such a habitation is far superior to
the sooty chimneys in which the young chimney
swifts break from their snow-white eggs and
twitter for food. How impatiently they must look
up at the blue sky, and one would think that they
must long for the time when they can spread their
sickle-shaped wings and dash about from dawn
to dark! Is it not wonderful that one of them
should live to grow up when we think of the fragile
little cup which is their home?&mdash;a mosaic of
delicate twigs held together only by the sticky
saliva of the parent birds.</p>
<p>A relation of theirs&mdash;though we should never
guess it&mdash;is sitting upon her tiny air castle high
up in an apple tree not far away,&mdash;a ruby-throated
hummingbird. If we take a peep into the nest
when the young hummingbirds are only partly
grown, we shall see that their bills are broad and
stubby, like those of the swifts. Their home, however,
is indeed a different affair,&mdash;a pinch of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
plant-down tied together with cobwebs and stuccoed
with lichens, like those which are growing all
about upon the tree. If we do not watch the female
when she settles to her young or eggs we
may search in vain for this tiniest of homes, so
closely does it resemble an ordinary knot on a
branch.</p>
<p>The flycatchers are well represented in the Park,
there being no fewer than five species; the least
flycatcher, wood pewee, ph&oelig;be, crested flycatcher,
and kingbird. The first two prefer the woods, the
ph&oelig;be generally selects a mossy rock or a bridge
beam, the fourth nests in a hollow tree and often
decorates its home with a snake-skin. The kingbird
builds an untidy nest in an apple tree. Our
American crow is, of course, a member of this
little community of birds, and that in spite of
persecution, for in the spring one or two are apt
to contract a taste for young ducklings and hence
have to be put out of the way. The fish crow, a
smaller cousin of the big black fellow, also nests
here, easily known by his shriller, higher caw. A
single pair of blue jays nest in the Park, but the
English starling occupies every box which is put
up and bids fair to be as great or a greater nuisance
than the sparrow. It is a handsome bird and
a fine whistler, but when we remember how this
foreigner is slowly but surely elbowing our native
birds out of their rightful haunts, we find ourselves
losing sight of its beauties. The cowbird,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
of course, imposes her eggs upon many of the
smaller species of birds, while our beautiful purple
grackle, meadow lark, red-winged blackbird,
and the Baltimore and orchard orioles rear their
young in safety. The cardinal, scarlet tanager,
indigo bunting, and rose-breasted grosbeak form
a quartet of which even a tropical land might well
be proud, and the two latter species have, in addition
to brilliant plumage, very pleasing songs.
Such wealth of æsthetic characteristics are unusual
in any one species, the wide-spread law of
compensation decreeing otherwise. More sombre
hued seed-eaters which live their lives in the Park
are towhees, swamp, song, field, and chipping
sparrows. The bank and barn swallows skim over
field and pond all through the summer, gleaning
their insect harvest from the air, and building
their nests in the places from which they have
taken their names. The rare rough-winged swallow
deigns to linger and nest in the Park as well
as do his more common brethren.</p>
<p>The dainty pensile nests which become visible
when the leaves fall in the autumn are swung by
four species of vireos, the white-eyed, red-eyed,
warbling, and yellow-throated. Of the interesting
and typically North American family of wood
warblers I have numbered no fewer than eight
which nest in the Park; these are the redstart,
the yellow-breasted chat, northern yellow-throat,
oven-bird, the yellow warbler, blue-winged, black-and-white
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
creeping warblers, and one other to be
mentioned later.</p>
<p>Injurious insects find their doom when the
young house and Carolina wrens are on the wing.
Catbirds and robins are among the most abundant
breeders, while chickadees and white-breasted
nuthatches are less often seen. The bluebird
haunts the hollow apple trees, and of the thrushes
proper the veery or Wilson&#8217;s and the splendid
wood thrush sing to their mates on the nests
among the saplings.</p>
<p>The rarest of all the birds which I have found
nesting in the Park is a little yellow and green
warbler, with a black throat and sides of the face,
known as the Lawrence warbler. Only a few of
his kind have ever been seen, and strange to say
his mate was none other than a demure blue-winged
warbler. His nest was on the ground and
from it six young birds flew to safety and not to
museum drawers.</p>

<h2>NIGHT MUSIC OF THE SWAMP</h2>
</div>

<p>To many, a swamp or marsh brings only the
very practical thought of whether it can be
readily drained. Let us rejoice, however, that
many marshes cannot be thus easily wiped out of
existence, and hence they remain as isolated bits
of primeval wilderness, hedged about by farms
and furrows. The water is the life-blood of the
marsh,&mdash;drain it, and reed and rush, bird and
batrachian, perish or disappear. The marsh, to
him who enters it in a receptive mood, holds,
besides mosquitoes and stagnation,&mdash;melody, the
mystery of unknown waters, and the sweetness of
Nature undisturbed by man.</p>
<p>The ideal marsh is as far as one can go from
civilisation. The depths of a wood holds its undiscovered
secrets; the mysterious call of the veery
lends a wildness that even to-day has not ceased to
pervade the old wood. There are spots overgrown
with fern and carpeted with velvety wet moss;
here also the skunk cabbage and cowslip grow
rank among the alders. Surely man cannot live
near this place&mdash;but the tinkle of a cowbell comes
faintly on the gentle stirring breeze&mdash;and our
illusion is dispelled, the charm is broken.</p>
<p>But even to-day, when we push the punt through
the reeds from the clear river into the narrow,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
tortuous channel of the marsh, we have left civilisation
behind us. The great ranks of the cat-tails
shut out all view of the outside world; the
distant sounds of civilisation serve only to accentuate
the isolation. It is the land of the Indian,
as it was before the strange white man, brought
from afar in great white-sailed ships, came to
usurp the land of the wondering natives. At any
moment we fancy that we may see an Indian canoe
silently round a bend in the channel.</p>
<p>The marsh has remained unchanged since the
days when the Mohican Indians speared fish there.
We are living in a bygone time. A little green
heron flies across the water. How wild he is;
nothing has tamed him. He also is the same now
as always. He does not nest in orchard or
meadow, but holds himself aloof, making no concessions
to man and the ever increasing spread of
his civilisation. He does not come to his doors
for food. He can find food for himself and in
abundance; he asks only to be let alone. Nor does
he intrude himself. Occasionally we meet him
along our little meadow stream, but he makes no
advances. As we come suddenly upon him, how
indignant he seems at being disturbed in his
hunting. Like the Indian, he is jealous of his ancient
domain and resents intrusion. He retires,
however, throwing back to us a cry of disdain.
Here in the marsh is the last stand of primitive
nature in the settled country; here is the last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
stronghold of the untamed. The bulrushes rise
in ranks, like the spears of a great army, surrounding
and guarding the colony of the marsh.</p>
<p>There seems to be a kinship between the voices
of the marsh dwellers. Most of them seem to have
a muddy, aquatic note. The boom of the frog
sounds like some great stone dropped into the
water; the little marsh wren&#8217;s song is the &#8220;babble
and tinkle of water running out of a silver flask.&#8221;</p>
<p>The blackbird seems to be the one connecting
link between the highlands and the lowlands.
Seldom does one see other citizens of the marsh
in the upland. How glorious is the flight of a
great blue heron from one feeding-ground to
another! He does not tarry over the foreign territory,
nor does he hurry. With neck and head
furled close and legs straight out behind, he pursues
his course, swerving neither to the right nor
the left.</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>

</td></tr></table>

<p>The blackbirds, however, are more neighbourly.
They even forage in the foreign territory, returning
at night to sleep.</p>
<p>In nesting time the red-wing is indeed a citizen
of the lowland. His voice is as distinctive of the
marsh as is the croak of the frog, and from a
distance it is one of the first sounds to greet the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
ear. How beautiful is his clear whistle with its
liquid break! Indeed one may say that he is the
most conspicuous singer of the marshlands. His
is not a sustained song, but the exuberant expression
of a happy heart.</p>
<p>According to many writers the little marsh
wren is without song. No song! As well say that
the farmer boy&#8217;s whistling as he follows the
plough, or the sailor&#8217;s song as he hoists the sail,
is not music! All are the songs of the lowly, the
melody of those glad to be alive and out in the
free air.</p>
<p>When man goes into the marsh, the marsh retires
within itself, as a turtle retreats within his
shell. With the exception of a few blackbirds and
marsh wrens, babbling away the nest secret, and
an occasional frog&#8217;s croak, all the inhabitants
have stealthily retired. The spotted turtle has
slid from the decayed log as the boat pushed
through the reeds. At our approach the heron
has flown and the little Virginia rail has scuttled
away among the reeds.</p>
<p>Remain perfectly quiet, however, and give the
marsh time to regain its composure. One by one
the tenants of the swamp will take up the trend
of their business where it was interrupted.</p>
<p>All about, the frogs rest on the green carpet of
the lily pads, basking in the sun. The little rail
again runs among the reeds, searching for food in
the form of small snails. The blackbirds and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
wrens, most domestic in character, go busily about
their home business; the turtles again come up to
their positions, and a muskrat swims across the
channel. One hopes that the little colony of marsh
wren homes on stilts above the water, like the
ancient lake dwellers of Tenochtitlan, may have
no enemies. But the habit of building dummy
nests is suggestive that the wee birds are pitting
their wits against the cunning of some enemy,&mdash;and
suspicion rests upon the serpent.</p>
<p>As evening approaches and the shadows from
the bordering wood point long fingers across the
marsh, the blackbirds straggle back from their
feeding-grounds and settle, clattering, among the
reeds. Their clamour dies gradually away and
night settles down upon the marsh.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>All sounds have ceased save the booming of the
frogs, which but emphasises the loneliness of it
all. A distant whistle of a locomotive dispels the
idea that all the world is wilderness. The firefly
lamps glow along the margin of the rushes. The
frogs are now in full chorus, the great bulls beating
their tom-toms and the small fry filling in the
chinks with shriller cries. How remote the scene
and how melancholy the chorus!</p>
<p>To one mind there is a quality in the frogs&#8217;
serenade that strikes the chord of sadness, to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
another the chord of contentment, to still another
it is the chant of the savage, just as the hoot of
an owl or the bark of a fox brings vividly to mind
the wilderness.</p>
<p>Out of the night comes softly the croon of a
little screech owl&mdash;that cry almost as ancient as
the hills. It belongs with the soil beneath our
towns. It is the spirit of the past crying to us.
So the dirge of the frog is the cry of the spirit of
river and marshland.</p>
<p>Our robins and bluebirds are of the orchard
and the home of man, but who can claim neighbourship
to the bittern or the bullfrog? There is
nothing of civilisation in the hoarse croak of the
great blue heron. These are all barbarians and
their songs are of the untamed wilderness.</p>
<p>The moon rises over the hills. The mosquitoes
have become savage. The marsh has tolerated us
as long as it cares to, and we beat our retreat.
The night hawks swoop down and boom as they
pass overhead. One feels thankful that the mosquitoes
are of some good in furnishing food to
so graceful a bird.</p>
<p>A water snake glides across the channel, leaving
a silver wake in the moonlight. The frogs
plunk into the water as we push past. A night
heron rises from the margin of the river and
slowly flops away. The bittern booms again as
we row down the peaceful river, and we leave the
marshland to its ancient and rightful owners.

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
<h2>THE COMING OF MAN</h2>
</div>

<p>If we betake ourselves to the heart of the deepest
forests which are still left upon our northern
hills, and compare the bird life which we find
there with that in the woods and fields near our
homes, we shall at once notice a great difference.
Although the coming of mankind with his axe and
plough has driven many birds and animals far
away or actually exterminated them, there are
many others which have so thrived under the new
conditions that they are far more numerous than
when the tepees of the red men alone broke the
monotony of the forest.</p>
<p>We might walk all day in the primitive woods
and never see or hear a robin, while in an hour&#8217;s
stroll about a village we can count scores. Let
us observe how some of these quick-witted feathered
beings have taken advantage of the way in
which man is altering the whole face of the land.</p>
<p>A pioneer comes to a spot in the virgin forest
which pleases him and proceeds at once to cut
down the trees in order to make a clearing. The
hermit thrush soothes his labour with its wonderful
song; the pileated woodpecker pounds its disapproval
upon a near-by hollow tree; the deer and
wolf take a last look out through the trees and
flee from the spot forever. A house and barn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
arise; fields become covered with waving grass
and grain; a neglected patch of burnt forest becomes
a tangle of blackberry and raspberry; an
orchard is set out.</p>
<p>When the migrating birds return, they are attracted
to this new scene. The decaying wood of
fallen trees is a paradise for ants, flies, and beetles;
offering to swallows, creepers, and flycatchers
feasts of abundance never dreamed of in the
primitive forests. Straightway, what must have
been a cave swallow becomes a barn swallow; the
haunter of rock ledges changes to an eave swallow;
the nest in the niche of the cliff is deserted
and ph&oelig;be becomes a bridgebird; cedarbirds are
renamed cherrybirds, and catbirds and other low-nesting
species find the blackberry patch safer
than the sweetbrier vine in the deep woods. The
swift leaves the lightning-struck hollow tree
where owl may harry or snake intrude, for the
chimney flue&mdash;sooty but impregnable.</p>
<p>When the great herds of ruminants disappear
from the western prairies, the buffalo birds without
hesitation become cowbirds, and when the
plough turns up the never-ending store of grubs
and worms the birds lose all fear and follow at
the very heels of the plough-boy: grackles, vesper
sparrows, and larks in the east, and flocks of gulls
farther to the westward.</p>
<p>The crow surpasses all in the keen wit which it
pits against human invasion and enmity. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
farmer declares war (all unjustly) against these
sable natives, but they jeer at his gun and traps
and scarecrows, and thrive on, killing the noxious
insects, devouring the diseased corn-sprouts,&mdash;doing
great good to the farmer in spite of himself.</p>
<p>The story of these sudden adaptations to conditions
which the birds could never have foreseen
is a story of great interest and it has been but half
told. Climb the nearest hill or mountain or even a
tall tree and look out upon the face of the country.
Keep in mind you are a bird and not a human,&mdash;you
neither know nor understand anything of
the reason for these strange sights,&mdash;these bipeds
who cover the earth with great square structures,
who scratch the ground for miles, who later gnaw
the vegetation with great shining teeth, and who
are only too often on the look out to bring sudden
death if one but show a feather. What would you
do?</p>

<h2>THE SILENT LANGUAGE OF ANIMALS</h2>

<p>What a great difference there is in brilliancy
of colouring between birds and the
furry creatures. How the plumage of a cardinal,
or indigo bunting, or hummingbird glows in the
sunlight, and reflects to our eyes the most intense
vermilion or indigo or an iridescence of the whole
gamut of colour. On the other hand, how sombrely
clad are the deer, the rabbits, and the mice;
gray and brown and white being the usual hue of
their fur.</p>
<p>This difference is by no means accidental, but
has for its cause a deep significance,&mdash;all-important
to the life of the bird or mammal. Scientists
have long known of it, and if we unlock it from
its hard sheathing of technical terms, we shall
find it as simple and as easy to understand as it
is interesting. When we once hold the key, it will
seem as if scales had fallen from our eyes, and
when we take our walks abroad through the fields
and woods, when we visit a zoological park, or
even see the animals in a circus, we shall feel as
though a new world were opened to us.</p>
<p>No post offices, or even addresses, exist for
birds and mammals; when the children of the
desert or the jungle are lost, no detective or
policeman hastens to find them, no telephone or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
telegraph aids in the search. Yet, without any
of these accessories, the wild creatures have marvellous
systems of communication. The five
senses (and perhaps a mysterious sixth, at which
we can only guess) are the telephones and the
police, the automatic sentinels and alarms of our
wild kindred. Most inferior are our own abilities
in using eyes, nose, and ears, when compared
with the same functions in birds and animals.</p>
<p>Eyes and noses are important keys to the bright
colours of birds and comparative sombreness of
hairy-coated creatures. Take a dog and an oriole
as good examples of the two extremes. When a
dog has lost his master, he first looks about; then
he strains his eyes with the intense look of a near-sighted
person, and after a few moments of this
he usually yelps with disappointment, drops his
nose to the ground, and with unfailing accuracy
follows the track of his master. When the freshness
of the trail tells him that he is near its end
he again resorts to his eyes, and is soon near
enough to recognise the face he seeks. A fox
when running before a hound may double back,
and make a close reconnaissance near his trail,
sometimes passing in full view without the
hound&#8217;s seeing him or stopping in following out
the full curve of the trail, so completely does the
wonderful power of smell absorb the entire attention
of the dog.</p>
<p>Let us now turn to the oriole. As we might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
infer, the nostrils incased in horn render the sense
of smell of but slight account. It is hard to tell
how much a bird can distinguish in this way&mdash;probably
only the odour of food near at hand.
However, when we examine the eye of our bird,
we see a sense organ of a very high order.
Bright, intelligent, full-circled, of great size compared
to the bulk of the skull, protected by three
complete eyelids; we realise that this must play
an important part in the life of the bird. There
are, of course, many exceptions to such a generalisation
as this. For instance, many species of
sparrows are dull-coloured. We must remember
that the voice&mdash;the calls and songs of birds&mdash;is
developed to a high degree, and in many instances
renders bright colouring needless in attracting
a mate or in locating a young bird.</p>
<p>As we have seen, the sense of smell is very
highly developed among four-footed animals, but
to make this efficient there must be something for
it to act upon; and in this connection we find some
interesting facts of which, outside of scientific
books, little has been written. On the entire body,
birds have only one gland&mdash;the oil gland above the
base of the tail, which supplies an unctuous dressing
for the feathers. Birds, therefore, have not
the power of perspiring, but compensate for this
by very rapid breathing. On the contrary, four-footed
animals have glands on many portions of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
the body. Nature is seldom contented with the
one primary function which an organ or tissue
performs, but adjusts and adapts it to others in
many ingenious ways. Hence, when an animal
perspires, the pores of the skin allow the contained
moisture to escape and moisten the surface
of the body; but in addition to this, in many
animals, collections of these pores in the shape
of large glands secrete various odours which serve
important uses. In the skunk such a gland is a
practically perfect protection against attacks
from his enemies. He never hurries and seems
not to know what fear is&mdash;a single wave of his
conspicuous danger signal is sufficient to clear
his path.</p>
<p>In certain species of the rhinoceros there are
large glands in the foot. These animals live
among grass and herbage which they brush
against as they walk, and thus &#8220;blaze&#8221; a plain
trail for the mate or young to follow. There are
few if any animals which care to face a rhinoceros,
so the scent is incidentally useful to other
creatures as a warning.</p>
<p>It is believed that the hard callosities on the
legs of horses are the remains of glands which
were once upon a time useful to their owners; and
it is said that if a paring from one of these hard,
horny structures be held to the nose of a horse, he
will follow it about, hinting, perhaps, that in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
former days the scent from the gland was an instinctive
guide which kept members of the herd
together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Civet,&#8221; which is obtained from the civet cat,
and &#8220;musk,&#8221; from the queer little hornless musk
deer, are secretions of glands. It has been suggested
that the defenceless musk deer escapes
many of its enemies by the similarity of its secretion
to the musky odour of crocodiles. In many
animals which live together in herds, such as the
antelope and deer, and which have neither bright
colours nor far-reaching calls to aid straying
members to regain the flock, there are large and
active scent glands. The next time you see a
live antelope in a zoological park, or even a
stuffed specimen, look closely at the head, and between
the eye and the nostril a large opening will
be seen on each, side, which, in the living animal,
closes now and then, a flap of skin shutting it
tight.</p>
<p>Among pigs the fierce peccary is a very social
animal, going in large packs; and on the back of
each of these creatures is found a large gland
from which a clear watery fluid is secreted. Dogs
and wolves also have their odour-secreting glands
on the back, and the &#8220;wolf-pack&#8221; is proverbial.</p>
<p>The gland of the elephant is on the temple, and
secretes only when the animal is in a dangerous
mood, a hint, therefore, of opposite significance
to that of the herding animals, as this says, &#8220;Let
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
me alone! stay away!&#8221; Certain low species of
monkeys, the lemurs, have a remarkable bare
patch on the forearm, which covers a gland serving
some use.</p>
<p>If we marvel at the keenness of scent among
animals, how incredible seems the similar sense
in insects&mdash;similar in function, however different
the medium of structure may be. Think of the
scent from a female moth, so delicate that we
cannot distinguish it, attracting a male of the
same species from a distance of a mile or more.
Entomologists sometimes confine a live female
moth or other insect in a small wire cage and
hang it outdoors in the evening, and in a short
time reap a harvest of gay-winged suitors which
often come in scores, instinctively following up
the trail of the delicate, diffused odour. It is
surely true that the greatest wonders are not
always associated with mere bulk.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
<h2>INSECT MUSIC</h2>
</div>

<p>Among insects, sounds are produced in many
ways, and for various reasons. A species
of ant which makes its nest on the under side of
leaves produces a noise by striking the leaf with
its head in a series of spasmodic taps, and another
ant is also very interesting as regards
its sound-producing habit. &#8220;Individuals of this
species are sometimes spread over a surface of
two square yards, many out of sight of the others;
yet the tapping is set up at the same moment, continued
exactly the same space of time, and
stopped at the same instant. After the lapse of a
few seconds, all recommence simultaneously. The
interval is always approximately of the same
duration, and each ant does not beat synchronously
with every other ant, but only like those in
the same group, so the independent tappings play
a sort of tune, each group alike in time, but the
tapping of the whole mass beginning and ending
at the same instant. This is doubtless a means of
communication.&#8221;</p>
<p>The organ of hearing in insects is still to be discovered
in many forms, but in katydids it is
situated on the middle of the fore-legs; in butterflies
on the sides of the thorax, while the tip of
the horns or antennæ of many insects is considered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
to be the seat of this function. In all it
is little more than a cavity, over which a skin is
stretched like a drum-head, which thus reacts to
the vibration. This seems to be very often
&#8220;tuned,&#8221; as it were, to the sounds made by the
particular species in which it is found. A cricket
will at times be unaffected by any sound, however
loud, while at the slightest &#8220;screek&#8221; or chirp
of its own species, no matter how faint, it will
start its own little tune in all excitement.</p>
<p>The songs of the cicadas are noted all over the
world. Darwin heard them while anchored half a
mile off the South American coast, and a giant
species of that country is said to produce a noise
as loud as the whistle of a locomotive. Only the
males sing, the females being dumb, thus giving
rise to the well-known Grecian couplet:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Happy the cicadas&#8217; lives,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>For they all have voiceless wives.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Anyone who has entered a wood where thousands
of the seventeen-year cicadas were hatching
has never forgotten it. A threshing machine,
or a gigantic frog chorus, is a fair comparison,
and when a branch loaded with these insects is
shaken, the sound rises to a shrill screech or
scream. This noise is supposed&mdash;in fact is definitely
known&mdash;to attract the female insect, and
although there may be in it some tender notes
which we fail to distinguish, yet let us hope that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
the absence of any highly organised auditory
organ may result in reducing the effect of a steam-engine
whistle to an agreeable whisper! It is
thought that the vibrations are felt rather than
heard, in the sense that we use the word &#8220;hear&#8221;;
if one has ever had a cicada <i>zizz</i> in one&#8217;s hand,
the electrical shocks which seem to go up the arm
help the belief in this idea. To many of us the
song of the cicada&mdash;softened by distance&mdash;will
ever be pleasant on account of its associations.
When one attempts to picture a hot August day
in a hay-field or along a dusty road, the drowsy
<i>zee-ing</i> of this insect, growing louder and more
accelerated and then as gradually dying away,
is a focus for the mind&#8217;s eye, around which the
other details instantly group themselves.</p>
<p>The apparatus for producing this sound is one
of the most complex in all the animal kingdom.
In brief, it consists of two external doors, capable
of being partly opened, and three internal membranes,
to one of which is attached a vibrating
muscle, which, put in motion, sets all the others
vibrating in unison.</p>
<p>We attach a great deal of importance to the
fact of being educated to the appreciation of the
highest class of music. We applaud our Paderewski,
and year after year are awed and delighted
with wonderful operatic music, yet seldom is the
<i>limitation</i> of human perception of musical sounds
considered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>If we wish to appreciate the limits within which
the human ear is capable of distinguishing sounds,
we should sit down in a meadow, some hot midsummer
day, and listen to the subdued running
murmur of the myriads of insects. Many are
very distinct to our ears and we have little trouble
in tracing them to their source. Such are crickets
and grasshoppers, which fiddle and rasp their
roughened hind legs against their wings. Some
butterflies have the power of making a sharp
crackling sound by means of hooks on the wings.
The katydid, so annoying to some in its persistent
ditty, so full of reminiscences to others of us, is
a large, green, fiddling grasshopper.</p>
<p>Another sound which is typical of summer is
the hum of insects&#8217; wings, sometimes, as near a
beehive, rising to a subdued roar. The higher,
thinner song of the mosquito&#8217;s wings is unfortunately
familiar to us, and we must remember that
the varying tone of the hum of each species may
be of the greatest importance to it as a means of
recognition. Many beetles have a projecting horn
on the under side of the body which they can
snap against another projection, and by this
means call their lady-loves, literally &#8220;playing the
bones&#8221; in their minstrel serenade.</p>
<p>Although we can readily distinguish the sounds
which these insects produce, yet there are hundreds
of small creatures, and even large ones,
which are provided with organs of hearing, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
whose language is too fine for our coarse perceptions.
The vibrations&mdash;chirps, hums, and clicks&mdash;can
be recorded on delicate instruments, but, just
as there are shades and colours at both ends of
the spectrum which our eyes cannot perceive, so
there are tones running we know not how far beyond
the scale limits which affect our ears. Some
creatures utter noises so shrill, so sharp, that it
pains our ears to listen to them, and these are
probably on the borderland of our sound-world.</p>

<h2>THE GRAY DAYS OF BIRDS</h2>
</div>

<p>The temptation is great, if we love flowers, to
pass over the seed time, when stalks are
dried and leaves are shrivelled, no matter how
beautiful may be the adaptation for scattering or
preserving the seed or how wonderful the protective
coats guarding against cold or wet. Or if
insects attract us by their many varied interests,
we are more enthusiastic over the glories of the
full-winged image than the less conspicuous,
though no less interesting, eggs and chrysalides
hidden away in crevices throughout the long
winter.</p>
<p>Thus there seems always a time when we
hesitate to talk or write of our favourite theme,
especially if this be some class of life on the earth,
because, perchance, it is not at its best.</p>
<p>Even birds have their gray days, when in the
autumn the glory of their plumage and song has
diminished. At this time few of their human
admirers intrude upon them and the birds themselves
are only too glad to escape observation.
Collectors of skins disdain to ply their trade, as
the ragged, pin-feathery coats of the birds now
make sorry-looking specimens. But we can find
something of interest in birddom, even in this
interim.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<p>Nesting is over, say you, when you start out on
your tramps in late summer or early autumn; but
do not be too sure. The gray purse of the oriole
has begun to ravel at the edges and the haircloth
cup of the chipping sparrow is already wind-distorted,
but we shall find some housekeeping
just begun.</p>
<p>The goldfinch is one of these late nesters. Long
after his northern cousins, the pine siskins and
snowflakes, have laid their eggs and reared their
young, the goldfinch begins to focus the aerial
loops of his flight about some selected spot and
to collect beakfuls of thistledown. And here, perhaps,
we have his fastidious reason for delaying.
Thistles seed with the goldenrod, and not until
this fleecy substance is gray and floating does he
consider that a suitable nesting material is available.</p>
<p>When the young birds are fully fledged one
would think the goldfinch a polygamist, as we see
him in shining yellow and black, leading his
family quintet, all sombre hued, his patient wife
being to our eyes indistinguishable from the
youngsters.</p>
<p>But in the case of most of the birds the cares
of nesting are past, and the woods abound with
full-sized but awkward young birds, blundering
through their first month of insect-hunting and fly-catching,
tumbling into the pools from which they
try to drink, and shrieking with the very joy of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
life, when it would be far safer for that very life
if they remained quiet.</p>
<p>It is a delightful period this, a transition as
interesting as evanescent. This is the time when
instinct begins to be aided by intelligence, when
every hour accumulates fact upon fact, all helping
to co-ordinate action and desire on the part of the
young birds.</p>
<p>No hint of migration has yet passed over the
land, and the quiet of summer still reigns; but
even as we say this a confused chuckling is heard;
this rises into a clatter of harsh voices, and a
small flock of blackbirds&mdash;two or three families&mdash;pass
overhead. The die is cast! No matter how
hot may be the sunshine during succeeding days,
or how contented and thoughtless of the future the
birds may appear, there is a something which has
gone, and which can never return until another
cycle of seasons has passed.</p>
<p>During this transition time some of our friends
are hardly recognisable; we may surprise the
scarlet tanager in a plumage which seems more
befitting a nonpareil bunting,&mdash;a regular &#8220;Joseph&#8217;s
coat.&#8221; The red of his head is half replaced
with a ring of green, and perhaps a splash of
the latter decorates the middle of his back. When
he flies the light shows through his wings in two
long narrow slits, where a pair of primaries are
lacking. It is a wise provision of Nature which
regulates the moulting sequence of his flight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
feathers, so that only a pair shall fall out at one
time, and the adjoining pair not before the new
feathers are large and strong. A sparrow or
oriole hopping along the ground with angular,
half-naked wings would be indeed a pitiful sight,
except to marauding weasels and cats, who would
find meals in abundance on every hand.</p>
<p>Let us take our way to some pond or lake, thick
with duckweed and beloved of wild fowl, and we
shall find a different state of affairs. We surprise
a group of mallard ducks, which rush out from the
overhanging bank and dive for safety among the
sheltering green arrowheads. But their outspread
wings are a mockery, the flight feathers
showing as a mere fringe of quill sticks, which
beat the water helplessly.</p>
<p>Another thing we notice. Where are the resplendent
drakes? Have they flown elsewhere
and left their mates to endure the dangers of
moulting alone? Let us come here a week later
and see what a transformation is taking place.
When most birds moult it is for a period of
several months, but these ducks have a partial
fall moult which is of the greatest importance to
them. When the wing feathers begin to loosen
in their sockets an unfailing instinct leads these
birds to seek out some secluded pond, where they
patiently await the moult. The sprouting, blood-filled
quills force out the old feathers, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
bird becomes a thing of the water, to swim and to
dive, with no more power of flight than its pond
companions, the turtles.</p>
<p>If, however, the drake should retain his iridescent
head and snowy collar, some sharp-eyed
danger would spy out his helplessness and death
would swoop upon him. So for a time his bright
feathers fall out and a quick makeshift disguise
closes over him&mdash;the reed-hued browns and grays
of his mate&mdash;and for a time the pair are hardly
distinguishable. With the return of his power of
flight comes renewed brightness, and the wild
drake emerges from his seclusion on strong-feathered,
whistling wings. All this we should
miss, did we not seek him out at this season;
otherwise the few weeks would pass and we should
notice no change from summer to winter plumage,
and attribute his temporary absence to a whim
of wandering on distant feeding grounds.</p>
<p>Another glance at our goldfinch shows a curious
sight. Mottled with spots and streaks, yellow
alternating with greenish, he is an anomaly indeed,
and in fact all of our birds which undergo
a radical colour change will show remarkable combinations
during the actual process.</p>
<p>It is during the gray days that the secret to a
great problem may be looked for&mdash;the why of
migration.</p>
<p>A young duck of the year, whose wings are at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
last strong and fit, waves them in ecstasy, vibrating
from side to side and end to end of his natal
pond. Then one day we follow his upward glances
to where a thin, black arrow is throbbing southward,
so high in the blue sky that the individual
ducks are merged into a single long thread. The
young bird, calling again and again, spurns the
water with feet and wings, finally rising in a
slowly ascending arc. Somewhere, miles to the
southward, another segment approaches&mdash;touches&mdash;merges.</p>
<p>But what of our smaller birds? When the gray
days begin to chill we may watch them hopping
among the branches all day in their search for
insects&mdash;a keener search now that so many of the
more delicate flies and bugs have fallen chilled to
the earth. Toward night the birds become more
restless, feed less, wander aimlessly about, but,
as we can tell by their chirps, remain near us until
night has settled down. Then the irresistible
maelstrom of migration instinct draws them upward,&mdash;upward,&mdash;climbing
on fluttering wings, a
mile or even higher into the thin air, and in company
with thousands and tens of thousands they
drift southward, sending vague notes down, but
themselves invisible to us, save when now and
then a tiny black mote floats across the face of
the moon&mdash;an army of feathered mites, passing
from tundra and spruce to bayou and palm.</p>
<p>In the morning, instead of the half-hearted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
warble of an insect eater, there sounds in our ears,
like the ring of skates on ice, the metallic, whip-like
chirp of a snowbird, confident of his winter&#8217;s
seed feast.</p>

<h2>LIVES OF THE LANTERN BEARERS</h2>
</div>

<p>To all wild creatures fire is an unknown and
hated thing, although it is often so fascinating
to them that they will stand transfixed gazing
at its mysterious light, while a hunter, unnoticed,
creeps up behind and shoots them.</p>
<p>In the depth of the sea, where the sun is powerless
to send a single ray of light and warmth,
there live many strange beings, fish and worms,
which, by means of phosphorescent spots and
patches, may light their own way. Of these
strange sea folk we know nothing except from
the fragments which are brought to the surface
by the dredge; but over our fields and hedges,
throughout the summer nights, we may see and
study most interesting examples of creatures
which produce their own light. Heedless of
whether the moon shines brightly, or whether an
overcast sky cloaks the blackest of nights, the
fireflies blaze their sinuous path through life.
These little yellow and black beetles, which illumine
our way like a cloud of tiny meteors, have
indeed a wonderful power, for the light which
they produce within their own bodies is a cold
glow, totally different from any fire of human
agency.</p>
<p>In some species there seems to be a most romantic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
reason for their brilliance. Down among the
grass blades are lowly, wingless creatures&mdash;the
female fireflies, which, as twilight falls, leave their
earthen burrows in the turf and, crawling slowly
to the summit of some plant, they display the tiny
lanterns which Nature has kindled within their
bodies.</p>
<p>Far overhead shoot the strong-winged males,
searching for their minute insect food, weaving
glowing lines over all the shadowy landscape,
and apparently heedless of all beneath them. Yet
when the dim little beacon, hung out with the
hopefulness of instinct upon the grass blade, is
seen, all else is forgotten and the beetle descends
to pay court to the poor, worm-like creature, so
unlike him in appearance, but whose little illumination
is her badge of nobility. The gallant suitor
is as devoted as if the object of his affection were
clad in all the gay colours of a butterfly; and he
is fortunate if, when he has reached the signal
among the grasses, he does not find a half-dozen
firefly rivals before him.</p>
<p>When insects seek their mates by day, their
characteristic colours or forms may be confused
with surrounding objects; or those which by night
are able in that marvellous way to follow the
faintest scent up wind may have difficulties when
cross currents of air are encountered; but the
female firefly, waiting patiently upon her lowly
leaf, has unequalled opportunity for winning her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
mate, for there is nothing to compare with or
eclipse her flame. Except&mdash;I wonder if ever a
firefly has hastened downward toward the strange
glow which we sometimes see in the heart of decayed
wood,&mdash;mistaking a patch of fox-fire for
the love-light of which he was in search!</p>
<p>In other species, including the common one
about our homes, the lady lightning-bug is more
fortunate in possessing wings and is able to fly
abroad like her mate.</p>
<p>Although this phosphorescence has been microscopically
examined, it is but slightly understood.
We know, however, that it is a wonderful
process of combustion,&mdash;by which a bright light is
produced without heat, smoke, or indeed fuel,
except that provided by the life processes in the
tiny body of the insect.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
<h2>A STARFISH AND A DAISY</h2>
</div>

<p>Day after day the forms of horses, dogs,
birds, and other creatures pass before our
eyes. We look at them and call them by the
names which we have given them, and yet&mdash;we
see them not. That is to say, we say that they
have a head, a tail; they run or fly; they are of
one colour beneath, another above, but beyond
these bare meaningless facts most of us never go.</p>
<p>Let us think of the meaning of form. Take,
for example, a flower&mdash;a daisy. Now, if we could
imagine such an impossible thing as that a daisy
blossom should leave its place of growth, creep
down the stem and go wandering off through the
grass, soon something would probably happen to
its shape. It would perhaps get in the habit of
creeping with some one ray always in front, and
the friction of the grass stems on either side
would soon wear and fray the ends of the side
rays, while those behind might grow longer and
longer. If we further suppose that this strange
daisy flower did not like the water, the rays in
front might be of service in warning it to turn
aside. When their tips touched the surface and
were wet by the water of some pool, the ambulatory
blossom would draw back and start out in a
new direction. Thus a theoretical head (with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
beginnings of the organs of sense), and a long-drawn-out
tail, would have their origin.</p>
<p>Such a remarkable simile is not as fanciful as
it might at first appear; for although we know
of no blossom which so sets at naught the sedentary
life of the vegetable kingdom, yet among certain
of the animals which live their lives beneath
the waves of the sea a very similar thing occurs.</p>
<p>Many miles inland, even on high mountains, we
may sometimes see thousands of little joints, or
bead-like forms, imbedded in great rocky cliffs.
They have been given the name of St. Cuthbert&#8217;s
beads. Occasionally in the vicinity of these fossils&mdash;for
such they are&mdash;are found impressions
of a graceful, flower-like head, with many delicately
divided petals, fixed forever in the hard relief
of stone. The name of stone lilies has been
applied to them. The beads were once strung together
in the form of a long stem, and at the top
the strangely beautiful animal-lily nodded its
head in the currents of some deep sea, which in
the long ago of the earth&#8217;s age covered the land&mdash;millions
of years before the first man or beast
or bird drew breath.</p>
<p>It was for a long time supposed that these wonderful
creatures were extinct, but dredges have
brought up from the dark depths of the sea actual
living stone lilies, or <i>crinoids</i>, this being their real
name. Few of us will probably ever have an opportunity
of studying a crinoid alive, although in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
our museums we may see them preserved in glass
jars. That, however, detracts nothing from the
marvel of their history and relationship. They
send root-like organs deep into the mud, where
they coil about some shell and there cling fast.
Then the stem grows tall and slender, and upon
the summit blooms or is developed the animal-flower.
Its nourishment is not drawn from the
roots and the air, as is that of the daisy, but is
provided by the tiny creatures which swim to its
tentacles, or are borne thither by the ocean currents.
Some of these crinoids, as if impatient of
their plant-like life and asserting their animal
kinship, at last tear themselves free from their
stem and float off, turn over, and thereafter live
happily upon the bottom of the sea, roaming
where they will, creeping slowly along and fulfilling
the destiny of our imaginary daisy.</p>
<p>And here a comparison comes suddenly to mind.
How like to a many-rayed starfish is our creeping
crinoid! Few of us, unless we had studies about
these creatures, could distinguish between a crinoid
and one of the frisky little dancing stars, or
serpent stars, which are so common in the rocky
caves along our coast. This relationship is no less
real than apparent. The hard-skinned &#8220;five
finger,&#8221; or common starfish, which we may pick
up on any beach, while it never grew upon a stem,
yet still preserves the radial symmetry of its
stalked ancestors. Pick up your starfish, carry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
it to the nearest field, and pluck a daisy close to
the head. How interesting the comparison becomes,
now that the knowledge of its meaning is
plain. Anything which grows fast upon a single
immovable stem tends to grow equally in all directions.
We need not stop here, for we may include
sea anemones and corals, those most marvellously
coloured flowers of the sea, which grow upon a
short, thick stalk and send out their tentacles
equally in all directions. And many of the jelly-fish
which throb along close beneath the surface
swells were in their youth each a section of a pile
of saucer-like individuals, which were fastened
by a single stalk to some shell or piece of coral.</p>
<p>We will remember that it was suggested that
the theoretical daisy would soon alter its shape
after it entered upon active life. This is plainly
seen in the starfish, although at first glance the
creature seems as radially symmetrical as a
wheel. But at one side of the body, between two
of the arms, is a tiny perforated plate, serving
to strain the water which enters the body, and
thus the circular tendency is broken, and a beginning
made toward right and left handedness. In
certain sea-urchins, which are really starfishes
with the gaps between the arms filled up, the body
is elongated, and thus the head and tail conditions
of all animals higher in the scale of life are represented.</p>

<h2>THE DREAM OF THE YELLOW-THROAT</h2>
</div>

<p>Many of us look with longing to the days
of Columbus; we chafe at the thought of
no more continents to discover; no unknown seas
to encompass. But at our very doors is an &#8220;undiscovered
bourne,&#8221; from which, while the traveller
invariably returns, yet he will have penetrated
but slightly into its mysteries. This unexplored
region is night.</p>
<p>When the dusk settles down and the creatures
of sunlight seek their rest, a new realm of life
awakens into being. The flaring colours and loud
bustle of the day fade and are lost, and in their
place come soft, gray tones and silence. The
scarlet tanager seeks some hidden perch and soon
from the same tree slips a silent, ghostly owl; the
ruby of the hummingbird dies out as the gaudy
flowers of day close their petals, and the gray
wraiths of sphinx moths appear and sip nectar
from the spectral moonflowers.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>With feet shod with silence, let us creep near a
dense tangle of sweetbrier and woodbine late some
summer evening and listen to the sounds of the
night-folk. How few there are that our ears can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
analyse! We huddle close to the ground and shut
our eyes. Then little by little we open them and
set our senses of sight and hearing at keenest
pitch. Even so, how handicapped are we compared
to the wild creatures. A tiny voice becomes
audible, then dies away,&mdash;entering for a moment
the narrow range of our coarse hearing,&mdash;and
finishing its message of invitation or challenge in
vibrations too fine for our ears.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Were we crouched by a dense yew hedge, bordering
an English country lane, a nightingale
might delight us,&mdash;a melody of day, softened,
adapted, to the night. If the air about us was
heavy with the scent of orange blossoms of some
covert in our own southland, the glorious harmony
of a mockingbird might surge through the gloom,&mdash;assuaging
the ear as do the blossoms another
sense.</p>
<p>But sitting still in our own home tangle let us
listen,&mdash;listen. Our eyes have slipped the scales
of our listless civilised life and pierce the darkness
with the acuteness of our primeval forefathers;
our ears tingle and strain.</p>
<p>A slender tongue of sound arises from the bush
before us. Again and again it comes, muffled but
increasing in volume. A tiny ball of feathers is
perched in the centre of the tangle, with beak
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
hidden in the deep, soft plumage, but ever and
anon the little body throbs and the song falls
gently on the silence of the night: &#8220;I beseech you!
I beseech you! I beseech you!&#8221; A Maryland
yellow-throat is asleep and singing in its dreams.</p>
<p>As we look and listen, a shadowless something
hovers overhead, and, looking upward, we see a
gray screech owl silently hanging on beating
wings. His sharp ears have caught the muffled
sound; his eyes search out the tangle, but the
yellow-throat is out of reach. The little hunter
drifts away into the blackness, the song ends and
the sharp squeak of a mouse startles us. We rise
slowly from our cramped position and quietly
leave the mysteries of the night.</p>

<h2>THE PASSING OF THE FLOCKS</h2>
</div>

<p>It is September. August&mdash;the month of gray
days for birds&mdash;has passed. The last pin-feather
of the new winter plumage has burst its
sheath, and is sleek and glistening from its thorough
oiling with waterproof dressing, which the
birds squeeze out with their bills from a special
gland, and which they rub into every part of their
plumage. The youngsters, now grown as large as
their parents, have become proficient in fly-catching
or berry-picking, as the case may be. Henceforth
they forage for themselves, although if we
watch carefully we may still see a parent&#8217;s love
prompting it to give a berry to its big offspring
(indistinguishable save for this attention), who
greedily devours it without so much as a wing
flutter of thanks.</p>
<p>Two courses are open to the young birds who
have been so fortunate as to escape the dangers
of nestlinghood. They may unite in neighbourly
flocks with others of their kind, as do the blackbirds
of the marshes; or they may wander off by
themselves, never going very far from their summer
home, but perching alone each night in the
thick foliage of some sheltering bush.</p>
<p>How wonderfully the little fellow adapts himself
to the radical and sudden change in his life!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
Before this, his world has been a warm, soft-lined
nest, with ever anxious parents to shelter
him from rain and cold, or to stand with half-spread
wings between him and the burning rays
of the sun. He has only to open his mouth and
call for food and a supply of the choicest morsels
appears and is shoved far down his throat. If
danger threatens, both parents are ready to fight
to the last, or even willing to give their lives to
protect him. Little wonder is it that the young
birds are loth to leave; we can sympathise heartily
with the last weaker brother, whose feet cling
convulsively to the nest, who begs piteously for
&#8220;just one more caterpillar!&#8221; But the mother
bird is inexorable and stands a little way out of
reach with the juiciest morsel she can find. Once
out, the young bird never returns. Even if we
catch the little chap before he finishes his first
flight and replace him, the magic spell of home is
broken, and he is out again the instant our hand
frees him.</p>
<p>What a change the first night brings! Yet with
unfailing instinct he squats on some twig, fluffs up
his feathers, tucks his wee head behind his wing,
and sleeps the sleep of his first adult birdhood
as soundly as if this position of rest had been
familiar to him since he broke through the shell.</p>
<p>We admire his aptitude for learning; how
quickly his wings gain strength and skill; how
soon he manages to catch his own dinner. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
how all this pales before the accomplishment of a
young brush turkey or moundbuilder of the antipodes.
Hatched six or eight feet under ground,
merely by the heat of decaying vegetation, no
fond parents minister to his wants. Not only
must he escape from the shell in the pressure
and darkness of his underground prison (how we
cannot tell), but he is then compelled to dig
through six feet of leaves and mould before he
reaches the sunlight. He finds himself well feathered,
and at once spreads his small but perfect
wings and goes humming off to seek his living
alone and unattended.</p>
<p>It is September&mdash;the month of restlessness for
the birds. Weeks ago the first migrants started
on their southward journey, the more delicate
insect-eaters going first, before the goldfinches
and other late nesters had half finished housekeeping.
The northern warblers drift past us
southward&mdash;the magnolia, blackburnian, Canadian
fly-catching, and others, bringing memories
of spruce and balsam to those of us who have
lived with them in the forests of the north.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s getting too cold for the little fellows,&#8221;
says the wiseacre, who sees you watching the
smaller birds as they pass southward. Is it,
though? What of the tiny winter wren which
spends the zero weather with us? His coat is
no warmer than those birds which have gone to
the far tropics. And what of the flocks of birds
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
which we occasionally come across in mid-winter,
of species which generally migrate to Brazil? It
is not the cold which deprives us of our summer
friends, or at least the great majority of them;
it is the decrease in food supply. Insects disappear,
and only those birds which feed on seeds
and buds, or are able to glean an insect diet from
the crevices of fence and tree-trunk, can abide.</p>
<p>This is the month to climb out on the roof of
your house, lie on your back and listen. He is a
stolid person indeed who is not moved by the
chirps and twitters which come down through the
darkness. There is no better way to show what
a wonderful power sound has upon our memories.
There sounds a robin&#8217;s note, and spring seems
here again; through the night comes a white-throat&#8217;s
chirp, and we see again the fog-dimmed
fields of a Nova Scotian upland; a sandpiper
&#8220;peets&#8221; and the scene in our mind&#8217;s eye as instantly
changes, and so on. What a revelation
if we could see as in daylight for a few moments!
The sky would be pitted with thousands and
thousands of birds flying from a few hundred
yards to as high as one or two miles above the
earth.</p>
<p>It only adds to the interest of this phenomenon
when we turn to our learned books on birds for
an explanation of the origin of migration, the
whence and whither of the long journeys by day
and night, and find&mdash;no certain answer! This is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
one of the greatest of the many mysteries of the
natural world, of which little is known, although
much is guessed, and the bright September nights
may reveal to us&mdash;we know not what undiscovered
facts.</p>

<h2>GHOSTS OF THE EARTH</h2>
</div>

<p>We may know the name of every tree near
our home; we may recognise each blossom
in the field, every weed by the wayside; yet we
should be astonished to be told that there are
hundreds of plants&mdash;many of them of exquisite
beauty&mdash;which we have overlooked in very sight
of our doorstep. What of the green film which
is drawn over every moist tree-trunk or shaded
wall, or of the emerald film which coats the water
of the pond&#8217;s edge? Or the gray lichens painting
the rocks and logs, toning down the shingles; the
toadstools which, like pale vegetable ghosts,
spring up in a night from the turf; or the sombre
puff balls which seem dead from their birth?</p>
<p>The moulds which cover bread and cheese with
a delicate tracery of filaments and raise on high
their tiny balls of spores are as worthy to be
called a plant growth as are the great oaks which
shade our houses. The rusts and mildews and
blights which destroy our fruit all have their
beauty of growth and fruition when we examine
them through a lens, and the yeast by which flour
and water is made to rise into the porous, spongy
dough is just as truly a plant as is the geranium
blossoming at the kitchen window.</p>
<p>If we wonder at the fierce struggle for existence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
which allows only a few out of the many seeds of
a maple or thistle to germinate and grow up, how
can we realise the obstacles with which these lowly
plants have to contend? A weed in the garden
may produce from one to ten thousand seeds, and
one of our rarest ferns scatters in a single season
over fifty millions spores; while from the larger
puff-balls come clouds of unnumbered millions of
spores, blowing to the ends of the earth; yet we
may search for days without finding one full-grown
individual.</p>
<p>All the assemblage of mushrooms and toadstools,&mdash;although
the most deadly may flaunt
bright hues of scarlet and yellow,&mdash;yet lack the
healthy green of ordinary plants. This is due to
the fact that they have become brown parasites or
scavengers, and instead of transmuting heat and
moisture and the salts of the earth into tissue by
means of the pleasant-hued chlorophyll, these
sylvan ghosts subsist upon the sap of roots or
the tissues of decaying wood. Emancipated from
the normal life of the higher plants, even flowers
have been denied them and their fruit is but a
cloud of brown dust,&mdash;each mote a simple cell.</p>
<p>But what of the delicate Indian pipe which
gleams out from the darkest aisles of the forest?
If we lift up its hanging head we will find a perfect
flower, and its secret is discovered. Traitor
to its kind, it has dropped from the ranks of the
laurels, the heather, and the jolly little wintergreens
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
to the colourless life of a parasite,&mdash;hobnobbing
with clammy toadstools and slimy lichens.
Its common names are all appropriate,&mdash;ice-plant,
ghost-flower, corpse-plant.</p>
<p>Nevertheless it is a delicately beautiful creation,
and we have no right to apply our human
standards of ethics to these children of the wild,
whose only chance of life is to seize every opportunity,&mdash;to
make use of each hint of easier existence.</p>
<p>We have excellent descriptions and classifications
of mushrooms and toadstools, but of the
actual life of these organisms, of the conditions
of their growth, little is known. Some of the
most hideous are delicious to our palate, some
of the most beautiful are certain death. The
splendid red and yellow amanita, which lights
up a dark spot in the woods like some flowering
orchid, is a veritable trap of death. Though
human beings have learned the fatal lesson and
leave it alone, the poor flies in the woods are
ever deceived by its brightness, or odour, and a
circle of their bodies upon the ground shows the
result of their ignorance.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
<h2>MUSKRATS</h2>
</div>

<p>Long before man began to inherit the earth,
giant beavers built their dams and swam in
the streams of long ago. For ages these creatures
have been extinct. Our forefathers, during historical
times, found smaller beavers abundant,
and with such zeal did they trap them that this
modern race is now well-nigh vanished. Nothing
is left to us but the humble muskrat,&mdash;which in
name and in facile adaptation to the encroachments
of civilization has little in common with his
more noble predecessor. Yet in many ways his
habits of life bring to mind the beaver.</p>
<p>Let us make the most of our heritage and watch
at the edge of a stream some evening in late
fall. If the muskrats have half finished their
mound of sticks and mud, which is to serve them
for a winter home, we will be sure to see some of
them at work. Two lines of ripples furrow the
surface outward from the farther bank, and a
small dark form clambers upon the pile of rubbish.
Suddenly a <i>spat!</i> sounds at our very feet,
and a muskrat dives headlong into the water,
followed by the one on the ground. Another <i>spat!</i>
and splash comes from farther down the stream,
and so the danger signal of the muskrat clan is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
passed along,&mdash;a single flap upon the water with
the flat of the tail.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>If we wait silent and patient, the work will be
taken up anew, and in the pale moonlight the
little labourers will fashion their house, lining
the upper chamber with soft grasses, and shaping
the steep passageway which will lead to the ever-unfrozen
stream-bed. Either here or in the snug
tunnel nest deep in the bank the young muskrats
are born, and here they are weaned upon toothsome
mussels and succulent lily roots.</p>
<p>Safe from all save mink and owl and trap, these
sturdy muskrats spend the summer in and about
the streams; and when winter shuts down hard
and fast, they live lives more interesting than any
of our other animals. The ground freezes their
tunnels into tubes of iron,&mdash;the ice seals the
surface, past all gnawing out; and yet, amid the
quietly flowing water, where snow and wind never
penetrate, these warm-blooded, air-breathing
muskrats live the winter through, with only the
trout and eels for company. Their food is the
bark and pith of certain plants; their air is what
leaks through the house of sticks, or what may
collect at the melting-place of ice and shore.</p>
<p>Stretched full length on the smooth ice, let us
look through into that strange nether world,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
where the stress of storm is unknown. Far beneath
us sinuous black forms undulate through
the water,&mdash;from tunnel to house and back again.
As we gaze down through the crystalline mass,
occasional fractures play pranks with the objects
below. The animate shapes seem to take unto
themselves greater bulk; their tails broaden, their
bodies become many times longer. For a moment
the illusion is perfect; thousands of centuries have
slipped back, and we are looking at the giant
beavers of old.</p>
<p>Let us give thanks that even the humble muskrat
still holds his own. A century or two hence
and posterity may look with wonder at his stuffed
skin in a museum!</p>

<h2>NATURE&#8217;S GEOMETRICIANS</h2>
</div>

<p>Spiders form good subjects for a rainy-day
study, and two hours spent in a neglected
garret watching these clever little beings will
often arouse such interest that we shall be glad
to devote many days of sunshine to observing
those species which hunt and build, and live their
lives in the open fields. There is no insect in the
world with more than six legs, and as a spider
has eight he is therefore thrown out of the company
of butterflies, beetles, and wasps and finds
himself in a strange assemblage. Even to his
nearest relatives he bears little resemblance, for
when we realise that scorpions and horseshoe
crabs must call him cousin, we perceive that his is
indeed an aberrant bough on the tree of creation.</p>
<p>Leaving behind the old-fashioned horseshoe
crabs to feel their way slowly over the bottom of
the sea, the spiders have won for themselves on
land a place high above the mites, ticks, and
daddy-long-legs, and in their high development
and intricate powers of resource they yield not
even to the ants and bees.</p>
<p>Nature has provided spiders with an organ
filled always with liquid which, on being exposed
to the air, hardens, and can be drawn out into
the slender threads we know as cobweb. The silkworm
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
encases its body with a mile or more of
gleaming silk, but there its usefulness is ended
as far as the silkworm is concerned. But spiders
have found a hundred uses for their cordage,
some of which are startlingly similar to human
inventions.</p>
<p>Those spiders which burrow in the earth hang
their tunnels with silken tapestries impervious
to wet, which at the same time act as lining to the
tube. Then the entrance may be a trap-door of
soil and silk, hinged with strong silken threads;
or in the turret spiders which are found in our
fields there is reared a tiny tower of leaves or
twigs bound together with silk. Who of us has
not teased the inmate by pushing a bent straw
into his stronghold and awaiting his furious onslaught
upon the innocent stalk!</p>
<p>A list of all the uses of cobwebs would take
more space than we can spare; but of these the
most familiar is the snare set for unwary flies,&mdash;the
wonderfully ingenious webs which sparkle
with dew among the grasses or stretch from bush
to bush. The framework is of strong webbing and
upon this is closely woven the sticky spiral which
is so elastic, so ethereal, and yet strong enough to
entangle a good-sized insect. How knowing seems
the little worker, as when, the web and his den of
concealment being completed, he spins a strong
cable from the centre of the web to the entrance
of his watch-tower. Then, when a trembling of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
his aerial spans warns him of a capture, how
eagerly he seizes his master cable and jerks away
on it, thus vibrating the whole structure and
making more certain the confusion of his victim.</p>
<p>What is more interesting than to see a great
yellow garden-spider hanging head downward in
the centre of his web, when we approach too
closely, instead of deserting his snare, set it vibrating
back and forth so rapidly that he becomes
a mere blur; a more certain method of escaping
the onslaught of a bird than if he ran to the shelter
of a leaf.</p>
<p>Those spiders which leap upon their prey instead
of setting snares for it have still a use for
their threads of life, throwing out a cable as they
leap, to break their fall if they miss their foothold.
What a strange use of the cobweb is that of the
little flying spiders! Up they run to the top of
a post, elevate their abdomens and run out several
threads which lengthen and lengthen until the
breeze catches them and away go the wingless
aeronauts for yards or for miles as fortune and
wind and weather may dictate! We wonder if
they can cut loose or pull in their balloon cables
at will.</p>
<p>Many species of spiders spin a case for holding
their eggs, and some carry this about with them
until the young are hatched.</p>
<p>A most fascinating tale would unfold could we
discover all the uses of cobweb when the spiders
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
themselves are through with it. Certain it is that
our ruby-throated hummingbird robs many webs
to fasten together the plant down, wood pulp,
and lichens which compose her dainty nest.</p>
<p>Search the pond and you will find another member
of the spider family swimming about at ease
beneath the surface, thoroughly aquatic in habits,
but breathing a bubble of air which he carries
about with him. When his supply is low he swims
to a submarine castle of silk, so air-tight that he
can keep it filled with a large bubble of air, upon
which he draws from time to time.</p>
<p>And so we might go on enumerating almost endless
uses for the web which is Nature&#8217;s gift to
these little waifs, who ages ago left the sea and
have won a place for themselves in the sunshine
among the butterflies and flowers.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>In the balsam-perfumed shade of our northern
forests we may sometimes find growing in abundance
the tiny white dwarf cornel, or bunch-berry,
as its later cluster of scarlet fruit makes the more
appropriate name. These miniature dogwood
blossoms (or imitation blossoms, as the white divisions
are not real petals) are very conspicuous
against the dark moss, and many insects seem to
seek them out and to find it worth while to visit
them. If we look very carefully we may find that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
this discovery is not original with us, for a little
creature has long ago found out the fondness of
bees and other insects for these flowers and has
put his knowledge to good use.</p>
<p>One day I saw what I thought was a swelling
on one part of the flower, but a closer look showed
it was a living spider. Here was protective
colouring carried to a wonderful degree. The
body of the spider was white and glistening, like
the texture of the white flower on which he
rested. On his abdomen were two pink, oblong
spots of the same tint and shape as the pinkened
tips of the false petals. Only by an accident could
he be discovered by a bird, and when I focussed
my camera, I feared that the total lack of contrast
would make the little creature all but invisible.</p>
<p>Confident with the instinct handed down
through many generations, the spider trusted implicitly
to his colour for safety and never moved,
though I placed the lens so close that it threw a
life-sized image on the ground-glass. When all
was ready, and before I had pressed the bulb,
the thought came to me whether this wonderful
resemblance should be attributed to the need of
escaping from insectivorous birds, or to the increased
facility with which the spider would be
able to catch its prey. At the very instant of making
the exposure, before I could will the stopping
of the movement of my fingers, if I had so wished,
my question was answered. A small, iridescent,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
green bee flew down, like a spark of living light,
upon the flower, and, quick as thought, was caught
in the jaws of the spider. Six of his eight legs
were not brought into use, but were held far back
out of the way.</p>
<p>Here, on my lens, I had a little tragedy of the
forest preserved for all time.</p>

<h2>AUTUMN HUNTING WITH A FIELD GLASS</h2>
</div>

<p>One of the most uncertain of months is October,
and most difficult for the beginner in
bird study. If we are just learning to enjoy the
life of wood and field, we will find hard tangles
to unravel among the birds of this month. Many
of the smaller species which passed us on their
northward journey last spring are now returning
and will, perhaps, tarry a week or more before
starting on the next nocturnal stage of their passage
tropicward. Many are almost unrecognisable
in their new winter plumage. Male scarlet
tanagers are now green tanagers, goldfinches are
olive finches, while instead of the beautiful black,
white, and cream dress which made so easy the
identification of the meadow bobolinks in the
spring, search will now be rewarded only by some
plump, overgrown sparrows&mdash;reedbirds&mdash;which
are really bobolinks in disguise.</p>
<p>Orchard orioles and rose-breasted grosbeaks
come and are welcomed, but the multitude of
female birds of these species which appear may
astonish one, until he discovers that the young
birds, both male and female, are very similar to
their mother in colour. We have no difficulty in
distinguishing between adult bay-breasted and
black poll warblers, but he is indeed a keen observer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
who can point out which is which when the
young birds of the year pass.</p>
<p>October is apt to be a month of extremes. One
day the woods are filled with scores of birds, and
on the next hardly one will be seen. Often a single
species or family will predominate, and one
will remember &#8220;thrush days&#8221; or &#8220;woodpecker
days.&#8221; Yellow-bellied sapsuckers cross the path,
flickers call and hammer in every grove, while in
the orchards, and along the old worm-eaten fences,
glimpses of red, white, and black show where redheaded
woodpeckers are looping from trunk to
post. When we listen to the warble of bluebirds,
watch the mock courtship of the high-holders, and
discover the fall violets under leaves and burrs,
for an instant a feeling of spring rushes over us;
but the yellow leaves blow against our face, the
wind sighs through the cedars, and we realise that
the black hand of the frost will soon end the brave
efforts of the wild pansies.</p>
<p>The thrushes, ranking in some ways at the head
of all our birds, drift through the woods, brown
and silent as the leaves around them. Splendid
opportunities they give us to test our powers of
woodcraft. A thrush passes like a streak of
brown light and perches on a tree some distance
away. We creep from tree to tree, darting nearer
when his head is turned. At last we think we are
within range, and raise our weapon. No, a leaf
is in the way, and the dancing spots of sunlight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
make our aim uncertain. We move a little closer
and again take aim, and this time he cannot escape
us. Carefully our double-barrelled binoculars
cover him, and we get what powder and lead could
never give us&mdash;the quick glance of the hazel eye,
the trembling, half-raised feathers on his head,
and a long look at the beautifully rounded form
perched on the twig, which a wanton shot would
destroy forever. The rich rufous colouring of
the tail proclaims him a singer of singers&mdash;a hermit
thrush. We must be on the watch these days
for the beautiful wood thrush, the lesser spotted
veery, the well named olive-back and the rarer
gray-cheeked thrush. We may look in vain among
the thrushes in our bird books for the golden-crowned
and water thrush, for these walkers of
the woods are thrushes only in appearance, and
belong to the family of warblers. The long-tailed
brown thrashers, lovers of the undergrowth, are
still more thrush-like in look, but in our classifications
they hold the position of giant cousins to the
wrens. Even the finches contribute a mock thrush
to our list, the big, spotted-breasted fox sparrow,
but he rarely comes in number before mid October
or November. Of course we all know that our
robin is a true thrush, young robins having their
breasts thickly spotted with black, while even
the old birds retain a few spots and streaks on
the throat.</p>
<p>If we search behind the screen of leaves and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
grass around us we may discover many tragedies.
One fall I picked up a dead olive-backed thrush
in the Zoological Park. There were no external
signs of violence, but I found that the food canal
was pretty well filled with blood. The next day
still another bird was found in the same condition,
and the day after two more. Within a week
I noted in my journal eight of these thrushes, all
young birds of the year, and all with the same
symptoms of disorder. I could only surmise that
some poisonous substance, some kind of berry,
perhaps some attractive but deadly exotic from
the Botanical Gardens, had tempted the inexperienced
birds and caused their deaths.</p>
<p>As we walk through the October woods a covey
of ruffed grouse springs up before us, overhead
a flock of robins dashes by, and the birds scatter
to feed among the wild grapes. The short round
wings of the grouse whirr noisily, while the quick
wing beats of the robins make little sound. Both
are suited to their uses. The robin may travel
league upon league to the south, while the grouse
will not go far except to find new bud or berry
pastures. His wings, as we have noticed before,
are fitted rather for sudden emergencies, to bound
up before the teeth of the fox close upon him, to
dodge into close cover when the nose of the hound
almost touches his trembling body. When he
scrambled out of his shell last May he at once
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
began to run about and to try his tiny wings, and
little by little he taught himself to fly. But in the
efforts he got many a tumble and broke or lost
many a feather. Nature, however, has foreseen
this, and to her grouse children she gives several
changes of wing feathers to practise with, before
the last strong winter quills come in.</p>
<p>How different it is with the robin. Naked and
helpless he comes from his blue shell, and only
one set of wing quills falls to his share, so it behooves
him to be careful indeed of these. He
remains in the nest until they are strong enough
to bear him up, and his first attempts are carefully
supervised by his anxious parents. And so
the glimpse we had in the October woods of the
two pair of wings held more of interest than we
at first thought.</p>
<p>In many parts of the country, about October
fifteenth the crows begin to flock back and forth
to and from their winter roosts. In some years it
is the twelfth, or again the seventeenth, but the
constancy of the mean date is remarkable. Many
of our winter visitants have already slipped into
our fields and woods and taken the places of some
of the earlier southern migrants; but the daily
passing of the birds which delay their journey
until fairly pinched by the lack of food at the
first frosts extends well into November. It is
not until the foliage on the trees and bushes becomes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
threadbare and the last migrants have
flown, that our northern visitors begin to take a
prominent place in our avifauna.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
<h2>A WOODCHUCK AND A GREBE</h2>
</div>

<p>No fact comes to mind which is not more impressed
upon us by the valuable aid of
comparisons, and Nature is ever offering antitheses.
At this season we are generally given a
brief glimpse&mdash;the last for the year&mdash;of two creatures,
one a mammal, the other a bird, which are
as unlike in their activities as any two living creatures
could well be.</p>
<p>What a type of lazy contentment is the woodchuck,
as throughout the hot summer days he lies
on his warm earthen hillock at the entrance of his
burrow. His fat body seems almost to flow down
the slope, and when he waddles around for a
nibble of clover it is with such an effort that we
feel sure he would prefer a comfortable slow
starvation, were it not for the unpleasant feelings
involved in such a proceeding.</p>
<p>As far as I know there are but two things which,
can rouse a woodchuck to strenuous activity;
when a dog is in pursuit he can make his stumpy
feet fairly twinkle as he flies for his burrow, and
when a fox or a man is digging him out, he can
literally worm his way through the ground, frequently
escaping by means of his wonderful
digging power. But when September or October
days bring the first chill, he gives one last yawn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
upon the world and stows himself away at the
farthest end of his tunnel, there to sleep away
the winter. Little more does he know of the snows
and blizzards than the bird which has flown to the
tropics. Even storing up fruits or roots is too
great an effort for the indolent woodchuck, and in
his hibernation stupor he draws only upon the fat
which his lethargic summer life has accumulated
within his skin.</p>
<p>As we might expect from a liver of such a slothful
life, the family traits of the woodchuck are far
from admirable and there is said to be little affection
shown by the mother woodchuck toward her
young. The poor little fellows are pushed out of
the burrow and driven away to shift for themselves
as soon as possible. Many of them must
come to grief from hawks and foxes. Closely
related to the squirrels, these large marmots (for
they are first cousins to the prairie dogs) are as
unlike them in activity as they are in choice of a
haunt.</p>
<p>What a contrast to all this is the trim feathered
form which we may see on the mill pond some
clear morning. Alert and wary, the grebe paddles
slowly along, watchful of every movement.
If we approach too closely, it may settle little by
little, like a submarine opening its water compartments,
until nothing is visible except the head with
its sharp beak. Another step and the bird has
vanished, swallowed up by the lake, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
chances are a hundred to one against our discovering
the motionless neck and the tiny eye
which rises again among the water weeds.</p>
<p>This little grebe comes of a splendid line of
ancestors, some of which were even more specialised
for an aquatic life. These paid the price
of existence along lines too narrow and vanished
from the earth. The grebe, however, has so far
stuck to a life which bids fair to allow his race
safety for many generations, but he is perilously
near the limit. Every fall he migrates far southward,
leaving his northern lakes, but if the water
upon which he floats should suddenly dry up, he
would be almost as helpless as the gasping fish;
for his wings are too weak to lift him from the
ground. He must needs have a long take-off, a
flying start, aided by vigorous paddling along the
surface of the water, before he can rise into the
air.</p>
<p>Millions of years ago there lived birds built on
the general grebe plan and who doubtless were
derived from the same original stock, but which
lived in the great seas of that time. Far from
being able to migrate, every external trace of
wing was gone and these great creatures, almost
as large as a man and with sharp teeth in their
beaks, must have hitched themselves like seals
along the edge of the beach, and perhaps laid their
eggs on the pebbles as do the terns to-day.</p>
<p>The grebe, denied the power to rise easily and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
even, to ran about on land without considerable
effort, is, however, splendidly adapted to its water
life, and the rapidity of its motions places it near
the head of the higher active creatures,&mdash;with the
woodchuck near the opposite extreme.</p>

<a name='THE_VOICE_OF_ANIMALS' id='THE_VOICE_OF_ANIMALS'></a>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
<h2>THE VOICE OF THE ANIMALS</h2>
</div>

<p>Throughout the depths of the sea, silence,
as well as absolute darkness, prevails. The
sun penetrates only a short distance below the
surface, at most a few hundred feet, and all disturbance
from storms ceases far above that depth,
Where the pressure is a ton or more to the square
inch, it is very evident that no sound vibration
can exist. Near the surface it is otherwise. The
majority of fishes have no lungs and of course no
vocal chords, but certain species, such as the drumfish,
are able to distend special sacs with gas or
air, or in other ways to produce sounds. One
variety succeeds in producing a number of sounds
by gritting the teeth, and when the male fish is
attempting to charm the female by dashing round
her, spreading his fins to display his brilliant
colours, this gritting of the teeth holds a prominent
place in the performance, although whether
the fair finny one makes her choice because she
prefers a high-toned grit instead of a lower one
can only be imagined! But vibrations, whether
of sound or of water pressure, are easily carried
near the surface, and fishes are provided with
organs to receive and record them. One class of
such organs has little in common with ears, as we
speak of them; they are merely points on the head
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
and body which are susceptible to the watery
vibrations. These points are minute cavities, surrounded
with tiny <i>cilia</i> or hairs, which connect
with the ends of the nerves.</p>
<p>The ears of the frogs and all higher animals
are, like the tongue-bone and the lower jaw,
derived originally from portions of gills, which
the aquatic ancestors of living animals used to
draw the oxygen from the water. This is one of
the most wonderful and interesting changes which
the study of evolution has unfolded to our
knowledge.</p>
<p>The disproportionate voices are produced by
means of an extra amount of skin on the throat,
which is distensible and acts as a drum to increase
the volume of sound. In certain bullfrogs which
grow to be as large as the head of a man, the bellowing
power is deafening and is audible for miles.
In Chile a small species of frog, measuring only
about an inch in length, has two internal vocal
sacs which are put to a unique use. Where these
frogs live, water is very scarce and the polliwogs
have no chance to live and develop in pools, as is
ordinarily the case. So when the eggs are laid,
they are immediately taken by the male frog and
placed in these capacious sacs, which serve as
nurseries for them all through their hatching and
growing period of life. Although there is no water
in these chambers, yet their gills grow out and
are reabsorbed, just as is the case in ordinary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
tadpoles. When their legs are fully developed,
they clamber up to their father&#8217;s broad mouth
and get their first glimpse of the great world from
his lower lip. When fifteen partly developed
polliwogs are found in the pouches of one little
frog, he looks as if he had gorged himself to bursting
with tadpoles. To such curious uses may vocal
organs be put.</p>
<p>Turtles are voiceless, except at the period of
laying eggs, when they acquire a voice, which even
in the largest is very tiny and piping, like some
very small insect rather than a two-hundred-pound
tortoise. Some of the lizards utter shrill,
insect-like squeaks.</p>
<p>A species of gecko, a small, brilliantly coloured
lizard, has the back of its tail armed with plates.
These it has a habit of rubbing together, and by
this means it produces a shrill, chirruping sound,
which actually attracts crickets and grasshoppers
toward the noise, so that they fall easy prey to
this reptilian trapper. So in colour, sound, motion,
and many other ways, animals act and react
upon each other, a useful and necessary habit
being perverted by an enemy, so that the death of
the creature results. Yet it would never be claimed
that the lizard thought out this mimicking. It
probably found that certain actions resulted in the
approach of good dinners, and in its offspring this
action might be partly instinctive, and each generation
would perpetuate it. If it had been an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
intentional act, other nearly related species of
lizards would imitate it, as soon as they perceived
the success which attended it.</p>
<p>That many animals have a kind of language is
nowadays admitted to be a truism, but this is more
evident among mammals and birds, and, reviewing
the classes of the former, we find a more or
less defined ascending complexity and increased
number of varying sounds as we pass from the
lower forms&mdash;kangaroos and moles&mdash;to the higher
herb-and-flesh-eaters, and particularly monkeys.</p>
<p>Squeaks and grunts constitute the vocabulary,
if we dignify it by that name, of the mammals.
The sloths, those curious animals whose entire
life is spent clinging to the underside of branches,
on whose leaves they feed, may be said almost to
be voiceless, so seldom do they give utterance to
the nameless wail which constitutes their only
utterance. Even when being torn to pieces by an
enemy, they offer no resistance and emit no sound,
but fold their claws around their body and submit
to the inevitable as silently and as stoically
as did ever an ancient Spartan.</p>
<p>Great fear of death will often cause an animal
to utter sounds which are different from those
produced under any other conditions. When an
elephant is angry or excited, his trumpeting is
terribly loud and shrill; but when a mother elephant
is &#8220;talking&#8221; to her child, while the same
sonorous, metallic quality is present, yet it is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
wonderfully softened and modulated. A horse is
a good example of what the fear of death will do.
The ordinary neigh of a horse is very familiar,
but in battle when mortally wounded, or having
lost its master and being terribly frightened, a
horse will scream, and those who have heard it,
say it is more awful than the cries of pain of a
human being.</p>
<p>Deer and elk often astonish one by the peculiar
sounds which they produce. An elk can bellow
loudly, especially when fighting; but when members
of a herd call to each other, or when surprised
by some unusual appearance, they whistle&mdash;a
sudden, sharp whistle, like the tin mouthpieces
with revolving discs, which were at one
time so much in evidence.</p>
<p>The growl of a bear differs greatly under varying
circumstances. There is the playful growl,
uttered when two individuals are wrestling, and
the terrible &#8220;sound&#8221;&mdash;no word expresses it&mdash;to
which a bear, cornered and driven to the last
extremity, gives utterance&mdash;fear, hate, dread, and
awful passion mingled and expressed in sound.
One can realise the fearful terror which this inspires
only when one has, as I have, stood up to a
mad bear, repelling charge after charge, with only
an iron pike between one&#8217;s self and those powerful
fangs and claws. The long-drawn moan of a
polar bear on a frosty night is another phase; this,
too, is expressive, but only of those wonderful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
Arctic scenes where night and day are as one to
this great seal-hunter.</p>
<p>The dog has made man his god,&mdash;giving up his
life for his master would be but part of his way
of showing his love if he had it in his power to do
more. So, too, the dog has attempted to adapt
his speech to his master&#8217;s, and the result is a bark.
No wild coyotes or wolves bark, but when bands
of dogs descended from domesticated animals run
wild, their howls are modulated and a certain unmistakable
barking quality imparted. The drawn-out
howl of a great gray wolf is an impressive
sound and one never to be forgotten. Only the
fox seems to possess the ability to bark in its
native tongue. The sounds which the cats, great
and small, reproduce are most varied. Nothing
can be much more intimidating than the roar of a
lion, or more demoniacal than the arguments
which our house-pets carry on at night on garden
fences.</p>
<p>What use the sounds peculiar to sea-lions subserve
in their life on the great ocean, or their
haunts along the shore, can only be imagined, but
surely such laudable perseverance, day after day,
to out-utter each other, must be for some good
reason!</p>
<p>Volumes have been written concerning the
voices of the two remaining groups of animals&mdash;monkeys
and birds. In the great family of the
four-handed folk, more varieties of sound are produced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
than would be thought possible. Some of
the large baboons are awful in their vocalisations.
Terrible agony or remorse is all that their moans
suggest to us, no matter what frame of mind on
the part of the baboon induces them. Of all vertebrates
the tiny marmosets reproduce most exactly
the chirps of crickets and similar insects, and to
watch one of these little human faces, see its mouth
open, and instead of, as seems natural, words issuing
forth, to hear these shrill squeaks is most surprising.
Young orang-utans, in their &#8220;talk,&#8221; as
well as in their actions, are counterparts of human
infants. The scream of frantic rage when a
banana is offered and jerked away, the wheedling
tone when the animal wishes to be comforted by
the keeper on account of pain or bruise, and the
sound of perfect contentment and happiness when
petted by the keeper whom it learns to love,&mdash;all
are almost indistinguishable from like utterances
of a human child.</p>
<p>But how pitiless is the inevitable change of the
next few years! Slowly the bones of the cranium
thicken, partly filling up the brain cavity, and
slowly but surely the ape loses all affection for
those who take care of it. More and more morose
and sullen it becomes until it reaches a stage of
unchangeable ferocity and must be doomed to
close confinement, never again to be handled or
caressed.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
<h2>THE NAMES OF ANIMALS, FROGS, AND FISH</h2>
</div>

<p>When, during the lazy autumn days, the
living creatures seem for a time to have
taken themselves completely beyond our ken, it
may be interesting to delve among old records and
descriptions of animals and see how the names by
which we know them first came to be given. Many
of our English names have an unsuspected ancestry,
which, through past centuries, has been
handed down to us through many changes of
spelling and meaning, of romantic as well as historical
interest.</p>
<p>How many people regard the scientific Latin
and Greek names of animals with horror, as being
absolutely beyond their comprehension, and yet
how interesting these names become when we look
them squarely in the face, analyse them and find
the appropriateness of their application.</p>
<p>When you say &#8220;wolf&#8221; to a person, the image
of that wild creature comes instantly to his mind,
but if you ask him <i>why</i> it is called a wolf, a hundred
chances to one he will look blankly at you.
It is the old fault, so common among us human
beings, of ignoring the things which lie nearest
us. Or perhaps your friend shares the state of
mind of the puzzled old lady, who, after looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
over a collection of fossil bones, said that she
could understand how these bones had been preserved,
and millions of years later had been discovered,
but it was a mystery to her how anyone
could know the names of these ancient animals
after such a lapse of time!</p>
<p>Some of the names of the commonest animals
are lost in the dimness of antiquity, such as fox,
weasel, sheep, dog, and baboon. Of the origin
of these we have forever lost the clew. With
camel we can go no farther back than the Latin
word <i>camelus</i>, and elephant balks us with the old
Hindoo word <i>eleph</i>, which means an ox. The old
root of the word wolf meant one who tears or
rends, and the application to this animal is obvious.
In several English and German names of
persons, we have handed down to us a relic of the
old fashion of applying wolf as a compliment to a
warrior or soldier. For example, Adolph means
noble-wolf, and Rudolph glory-wolf.</p>
<p>Lynx is from the same Latin word as the word
<i>lux</i> (light) and probably was given to these wildcats
on account of the brightness of their eyes.
Lion is, of course, from the Latin <i>leo</i>, which word,
in turn, is lost far back in the Egyptian tongue,
where the word for the king of beasts was <i>labu</i>.
The compound word leopard is first found in the
Persian language, where <i>pars</i> stands for panther.
Seal, very appropriately, was once a word meaning
&#8220;of the sea&#8221;; close to the Latin <i>sal</i>, the sea.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>Many names of animals are adapted from words
in the ancient language of the natives in whose
country the creatures were first discovered.
Puma, jaguar, tapir, and peccary (from <i>paquires</i>)
are all names from South American Indian languages.
The coyote and ocelot were called <i>coyotl</i>
and <i>ocelotl</i> by the Mexicans long before Cortes
landed on their shores. Zebra, gorilla, and chimpanzee
are native African words, and orang-utan
is Malay, meaning Man of the Woods. Cheetah
is from some East Indian tongue, as is tahr, the
name of the wild goat of the Himalayas. Gnu is
from the Hottentots, and giraffe from the Arabic
<i>zaraf</i>. Aoudad, the Barbary wild sheep, is the
French form of the Moorish name <i>audad</i>.</p>
<p>The native Indians of our own country are passing
rapidly, and before many years their race may
be extinct, but their musical, euphonious names
of the animals they knew so well, often pleased the
ear of the early settlers, and in many instances
will be a lasting memorial as long as these forest
creatures of our United States survive.</p>
<p>Thus, moose is from the Indian word <i>mouswah</i>,
meaning wood-eater; skunk from <i>seganku</i>, an
Algonquin term; <i>wapiti</i>, in the Cree language,
meant white deer, and was originally applied to
the Rocky Mountain goat, but the name is now
restricted to the American elk. Caribou is also
an Indian word; opossum is from <i>possowne</i>, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
raccoon is from the Indian <i>arrathkune</i> (by further
apheresis, coon).</p>
<p>Rhinoceros is pure Greek, meaning nose-horned,
but beaver has indeed had a rough time of it in
its travels through various languages. It is hardly
recognisable as <i>bebrus</i>, <i>babbru</i>, and <i>bbru</i>. The
latter is the ultimate root of our word brown.
The original application was, doubtless, on account
of the colour of the creature&#8217;s fur. Otter
takes us back to Sanskrit, where we find it <i>udra</i>.
The significance of this word is in its close kinship
to <i>udan</i>, meaning water.</p>
<p>The little mouse hands his name down through
the years from the old, old Sanskrit, the root
meaning to steal. Many people who never heard
of Sanskrit have called him and his descendants
by terms of homologous significance! The word
muscle is from the same root, and was applied
from a fancied resemblance of the movement of
the muscle beneath the skin to a mouse in motion&mdash;not
a particularly quieting thought to certain
members of the fair sex! The origin of the word
rat is less certain, but it may have been derived
from the root of the Latin word <i>radere</i>, to scratch,
or <i>rodere</i>, to gnaw. Rodent is derived from the
latter term. Cat is also in doubt, but is first
recognised in <i>catalus</i>, a diminutive of <i>canis</i>, a dog.
It was applied to the young of almost any animal,
as we use the words pup, kitten, cub, and so forth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
Bear is the result of tongue-twisting from the
Latin <i>fera</i>, a wild beast.</p>
<p>Ape is from the Sanskrit <i>kapi</i>; <i>kap</i> in the same
language means tremble; but the connection is not
clear. Lemur, the name given to that low family
of monkeys, is from the plural Latin word
<i>lemures</i>, meaning ghost or spectre. This has
reference to the nocturnal habits, stealthy gait,
and weird expression of these large-eyed creatures.
Antelope is probably of Grecian origin,
and was originally applied to a half-mythical animal,
located on the banks of the Euphrates, and
described as &#8220;very savage and fleet, and having
long, saw-like horns with which it could cut down
trees. It figures largely in the peculiar fauna of
heraldry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Deer is of obscure origin, but may have been
an adjective meaning wild. Elk is derived from
the same root as eland, and the history of the latter
word is an interesting one. It meant a
sufferer, and was applied by the Teutons to the
elk of the Old World on account of the awkward
gait and stiff movements of this ungainly animal.
But in later years the Dutch carried the same
word, eland, to South Africa, and there gave it
to the largest of the tribe of antelopes, in which
sense it is used by zoologists to-day.</p>
<p>Porcupine has arisen from two Latin words,
<i>porcus</i>, a hog, and <i>spina</i>, a spine; hence, appropriately,
a spiny-hog. Buffalo may once have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
been some native African name. In the vista of
time, our earliest glimpse of it is as <i>bubalus</i>,
which was applied both to the wild ox and to a
species of African antelope. Fallow deer is from
fallow, meaning pale, or yellowish, while axis, as
applied to the deer so common in zoological gardens,
was first mentioned by Pliny and is doubtless
of East Indian origin. The word bison is from
the Anglo-Saxon <i>wesend</i>, but beyond Pliny its
ultimate origin eludes all research.</p>
<p>Marmot, through various distortions, looms up
from Latin times as <i>mus montanus</i>, literally a
mountain mouse. Badger is from badge, in allusion
to the bands of white fur on its forehead.
The verb meaning to badger is derived from the
old cruel sport of baiting badgers with dogs.</p>
<p>Monkey is from the same root as <i>monna</i>, a
woman; more especially an old crone, in reference
to the fancied resemblance of the weazened face
of a monkey to that of a withered old woman.
Madam and madonna are other forms of words
from the same root, so wide and sweeping are the
changes in meaning which usage and time can give
to words.</p>
<p>Squirrel has a poetic origin in the Greek language;
its original meaning being shadow-tail.
Tiger is far more intricate. The old Persian word
<i>tir</i> meant arrow, while <i>tighra</i> signified sharp. The
application to this great animal was in allusion to
the swiftness with which the tiger leaps upon his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
prey. The river Tigris, meaning literally the
river Arrow, is named thus from the swiftness
of its current.</p>
<p>As to the names of reptiles it is, of course, to
the Romans that we are chiefly indebted, as in the
case of reptile from <i>reptilus</i>, meaning creeping;
and crocodile from <i>dilus</i>, a lizard. Serpent is also
from the Latin <i>serpens</i>, creeping, and this from
the old Sanskrit root, <i>sarp</i>, with the same meaning.
This application of the idea of creeping is
again found in the word snake, which originally
came from the Sanskrit <i>naga</i>.</p>
<p>Tortoise harks back to the Latin <i>tortus</i>, meaning
twisted (hence our word tortuous) and came
to be applied to these slow creatures because of
their twisted legs. In its evolution through many
tongues it has suffered numbers of variations; one
of these being turtle, which we use to-day to designate
the smaller land tortoises. Terrapin and its
old forms <i>terrapene</i> and <i>turpin</i>, on the contrary,
originated in the New World, in the language of
the American Redskin.</p>
<p><i>Cobra-de-capello</i> is Portuguese for hooded
snake, while python is far older, the same word
being used by the Greeks to denote a spirit, demon,
or evil-soothsayer. This name was really given
to designate any species of large serpent. <i>Boa</i> is
Latin and was also applied to a large snake, while
the importance of the character of size is seen,
perhaps, in our words <i>bos</i> and <i>bovine</i>.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></p>
<p>The word viper is interesting; coming directly
from the Romans, who wrote it <i>vipera</i>. This in
turn is a contraction of the feminine form of the
adjective <i>vivipera</i>, in reference to the habit of
these snakes of bringing forth their young alive.</p>
<p>Lizard, through such forms as <i>lesarde</i>, <i>lezard</i>,
<i>lagarto</i>, <i>lacerto</i>, is from the Latin <i>lacertus</i>, a
lizard; while closely related is the word alligator
by way of <i>lagarto</i>, <i>aligarto</i>, to alligator. The
prefix may have arisen as a corruption of an article
and a noun, as in the modern Spanish <i>el
lagarto</i>,&mdash;a lizard.</p>
<p>Monitor is Latin for one who reminds, these
lizards being so called because they are supposed
to give warning of the approach of crocodiles.
Asp can be carried back to the <i>aspis</i> of the
Romans, no trace being found in the dim vistas of
preceding tongues.</p>
<p>Gecko, the name of certain wall-hunting lizards,
is derived from their croaking cry; while iguana
is a Spanish name taken from the old native
Haytian appellation <i>biuana</i>.</p>
<p>Of the word frog we know nothing, although
through the medium of many languages it has had
as thorough an evolution as in its physical life.
We must also admit our ignorance in regard to
toad, backward search revealing only <i>tade</i>, <i>tode</i>,
<i>ted</i>, <i>toode</i>, and <i>tadie</i>, the root baffling all study.
Polliwog and tadpole are delightfully easy. Old
forms of polliwog are <i>pollywig</i>, <i>polewiggle</i>, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
<i>pollwiggle</i>. This last gives us the clew to our
spelling&mdash;<i>pollwiggle</i>, which, reversed and interpreted
in a modern way, is wigglehead, a most
appropriate name for these lively little black fellows.
Tadpole is somewhat similar; toad-pole, or
toad&#8217;s-head, also very apt when we think of these
small-bodied larval forms.</p>
<p>Salamander, which is a Greek word of Eastern
origin, was applied in the earliest times to a lizard
considered to have the power of extinguishing fire.
Newt has a strange history; originating in a
wrong division of two words, &#8220;<i>an ewte</i>,&#8221; the latter
being derived from <i>eft</i>, which is far more correct
than newt, though in use now in only a few
places. Few fishermen have ever thought of the
interesting derivation of the names which they
know so well. Of course there are a host of fishes
named from a fancied resemblance to familiar
terrestrial animals or other things; such as the
catfish, and those named after the dog, hog, horse,
cow, trunk, devil, angel, sun, and moon.</p>
<p>The word fish has passed through many varied
forms since it was <i>piscis</i> in the old Latin tongue,
and the same is true of shark and skate, which in
the same language were <i>carcharus</i> and <i>squatus</i>.
Trout was originally <i>tructa</i>, which in turn is lost
in a very old Greek word, meaning eat or gnaw.
Perch harks back to the Latin <i>perca</i>, and the
Romans had it from the Greeks, among whom it
meant spotted. The Romans said <i>minutus</i> when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
they meant small, and nowadays when we speak
of any very small fish we say minnow. Alewife
in old English was applied to the women, usually
very stout dames, who kept alehouses. The corpulency
of the fish to which the same term is given
explains its derivation.</p>
<p>The pike is so named from the sharp, pointed
snout and long, slim body, bringing to mind the
old-time weapon of that name; while pickerel
means doubly a little pike, the <i>er</i> and <i>el</i> (as in cock
and cockerel) both being diminutives. Smelt was
formerly applied to any small fish and comes, perhaps,
from the Anglo-Saxon <i>smeolt</i>, which meant
smooth&mdash;the smoothness and slipperiness of the
fish suggesting the name.</p>
<p>Salmon comes directly from the Latin <i>salmo</i>, a
salmon, which literally meant the leaper, from
<i>salire</i>&mdash;to leap. Sturgeon, from the Saxon was
<i>stiriga</i>, literally a stirrer, from the habit of the
fish of stirring up the mud at the bottom of the
water. Dace, through its mediæval forms <i>darce</i>
and <i>dars</i>, is from the same root as our word dart,
given on account of the swiftness of the fish.</p>
<p>Anchovy is interesting as perhaps from the
Basque word <i>antzua</i>, meaning dry; hence the dried
fish; and mullet is from the Latin <i>mullus</i>. Herring
is well worth following back to its origin. We
know that the most marked habit of fishes of this
type is their herding together in great schools or
masses or armies. In the very high German <i>heri</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
meant an army or host; hence our word harry
and, with a suffix, herring.</p>
<p><i>Hake</i> in Norwegian means hook, and the term
hake or hook-fish was given because of the hooked
character of the under-jaw. Mackerel comes from
<i>macarellus</i> and originally the Latin <i>macula</i>&mdash;spotted,
from the dark spots on the body. Roach
and ray both come from the Latin <i>raria</i>, applied
then as in the latter case now to bottom-living
sharks.</p>
<p>Flounder comes from the verb, which in turn
is derived from flounce, a word which is lost in
antiquity. Tarpon (and the form <i>tarpum</i>) may
be an Indian word; while there is no doubt as to
grouper coming from <i>garrupa</i>, a native Mexican
name. Chubb (a form of cub) meant a chunky
mass or lump, referring to the body of the fish.
Shad is lost in <i>sceadda</i>, Anglo-Saxon for the same
fish.</p>
<p>Lamprey and halibut both have histories, which,
at first glance, we would never suspect, although
the forms have changed but little. The former
have a habit of fastening themselves for hours to
stones and rocks, by means of their strong, sucking
mouths. So the Latin form of the word <i>lampetra</i>,
or literally lick-rock, is very appropriate.
Halibut is equally so. <i>But</i> or <i>bot</i> in several languages
means a certain flounder-like fish, and in
olden times this fish was eaten only on holidays
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
(<i>i.e.</i>, holy days). Hence the combination halibut
means really holy-flounder.</p>
<p>The meaning of these words and many others
are worth knowing, and it is well to be able to
answer with other than ignorance the question
&#8220;What&#8217;s in a name?&#8221;</p>

<h2>THE DYING YEAR</h2>
</div>

<p>When a radical change of habits occurs, as
in the sapsucker, deviating so sharply
from the ancient principles of its family, many
other forms of life about it are influenced, indirectly,
but in a most interesting way. In its
tippling operations it wastes quantities of sap
which exudes from the numerous holes and
trickles down the bark of the wounded tree. This
proves a veritable feast for the forlorn remnant
of wasps and butterflies,&mdash;the year&#8217;s end stragglers
whose flower calyces have fallen and given
place to swelling seeds.</p>
<p>Swiftly up wind they come on the scent, eager
as hounds on the trail, and they drink and drink
of the sweets until they become almost incapable
of flying. But, after all, the new lease of life is a
vain semblance of better things. Their eggs have
long since been laid and their mission in life ended,
and at the best their existence is but a matter of
days.</p>
<p>It is a sad thing this, and sometimes our heart
hardens against Nature for the seeming cruelty
of it all. Forever and always, year after year,
century upon century, the same tale unfolds itself,&mdash;the
sacrifice of the individual for the good of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
race. A hundred drones are tended and reared,
all but one to die in vain; a thousand seeds are
sown to rot or to sprout and wither; a million little
codfish hatch and begin life hopefully, perhaps
all to succumb save one; a million million shrimp
and pteropods paddle themselves here and there
in the ocean, and every one is devoured by fish or
swept into the whalebone tangle from which none
ever return. And if a lucky one which survives
does so because it has some little advantage over
its fellows,&mdash;some added quality which gives just
the opportunity to escape at the critical moment,&mdash;then
the race will advance to the extent of that
trifle and so carry out the precept of evolution.
But even though we may owe every character of
body and mind to the fulfilment of some such inexorable
law in the past, yet the witnessing of the
operation brings ever a feeling of cruelty, of injustice
somewhere.</p>
<p>How pitiful the weak flight of the last yellow
butterfly of the year, as with tattered and battered
wings it vainly seeks for a final sip of
sweets! The fallen petals and the hard seeds are
black and odourless, the drops of sap are
hardened. Little by little the wings weaken, the
tiny feet clutch convulsively at a dried weed stalk,
and the four golden wings drift quietly down
among the yellow leaves, soon to merge into the
dark mould beneath. As the butterfly dies, a
stiffened Katydid scratches a last requiem on his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
wing covers&mdash;&#8220;<i>katy-didn&#8217;t&mdash;katy-did&mdash;kate&mdash;y</i>&#8221;&mdash;and
the succeeding moment of silence is broken
by the sharp rattle of a woodpecker. We shake
off every dream of the summer and brace ourselves
to meet and enjoy the keen, invigorating
pleasures of winter.

<h2>NOVEMBER&#8217;S BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS</h2>
</div>

<p>As the whirling winds of winter&#8217;s edge strip
the trees bare of their last leaves, the leaden
sky of the eleventh month seems to push its cold
face closer to earth. Who can tell when the northern
sparrows first arrive? A whirl of brown
leaves scatters in front of us; some fall back to
earth; others rise and perch in the thick briers,&mdash;sombre
little white-throated and tree sparrows!
These brown-coated, low-voiced birds easily attract
our attention, the more now that the great
host of brilliant warblers has passed, just as our
hearts warm toward the humble poly-pody fronds
(passing them by unnoticed when flowers are
abundant) which now hold up their bright greenness
amid all the cold.</p>
<p>But all the migrants have not left us yet by any
means, and we had better leave our boreal visitors
until mid-winter&#8217;s blasts show us these
hardiest of the hardy at their best.</p>
<p>We know little of the ways of the gaunt herons
on their southward journey, but day after day, in
the marshes and along the streams, we may see
the great blues as they stop in their flight to rest
for a time.</p>
<p>The cold draws all the birds of a species
together. Dark hordes of clacking grackles pass
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
by, scores of red-winged blackbirds and cowbirds
mingle amicably together, both of dark hue but
of such unlike matrimonial habits. A single male
red-wing, as we have seen, may assume the cares
of a harem of three, four, or five females, each of
which rears her brown-streaked offspring in her
own particular nest, while the valiant guardian
keeps faithful watch over his small colony among
the reeds and cat-tails. But little thought or care
does mother cowbird waste upon her offspring.
No home life is hers&mdash;merely a stealthy approach
to the nest of some unsuspecting yellow warbler,
or other small bird, a hastily deposited egg, and
the unnatural parent goes on her way, having
shouldered all her household cares on another.
Her young may be hatched and carefully reared
by the patient little warbler mother, or the egg
may spoil in the deserted nest, or be left in the
cold beneath another nest bottom built over it;
little cares the cowbird.</p>
<p>The ospreys or fish hawks seem to circle southward
in pairs or trios, but some clear, cold day
the sky will be alive with hawks of other kinds.
It is a strange fact that these birds which have
the power to rise so high that they fairly disappear
from our sight choose the trend of terrestrial
valleys whenever possible, in directing their
aerial routes. Even the series of New Jersey
hills, flattered by the name of the Orange Mountains,
seem to balk many hawks which elect to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
change their direction and fly to the right or left
toward certain gaps or passes. Through these a
raptorial stream pours in such numbers during
the period of migration that a person with a foreknowledge
of their path in former years may lie
in wait and watch scores upon scores of these
birds pass close overhead within a few hours,
while a short distance to the right or left one may
watch all day without seeing a single raptor. The
whims of migrating birds are beyond our ken.</p>
<p>Sometimes, out in the broad fields, one&#8217;s eyes
will be drawn accidentally upward, and a great
flight of hawks will be seen&mdash;a compact flock of
intercircling forms, perhaps two or three hundred
in all, the whole number gradually passing
from view in a southerly direction, now and then
sending down a shrill cry. It is a beautiful sight,
not very often to be seen near a city&mdash;unless
watched for.</p>
<p>To a dweller in a city or its suburbs I heartily
commend at this season the forming of this habit,&mdash;to
look upward as often as possible on your
walks. An instant suffices to sweep the whole
heavens with your eye, and if the distant circling
forms, moving in so stately a manner, yet so
swiftly, and in their every movement personifying
the essence of wild and glorious freedom,&mdash;if this
sight does not send a thrill through the onlooker,
then he may at once pull his hat lower over his
eyes and concern himself only with his immediate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
business. The joys of Nature are not for such as
he; the love of the wild which exists in every one
of us is, in him, too thickly &#8220;sicklied o&#8217;er&#8221; with
the veneer of convention and civilisation.</p>
<p>Even as late as November, when the water
begins to freeze in the tiny cups of the pitcher
plants, and the frost brings into being a new kind
of foliage on glass and stone, a few insect-eaters
of the summer woods still linger on. A belated
red-eyed vireo may be chased by a snowbird, and
when we approach a flock of birds, mistaking them
at a distance for purple finches, we may discover
they are myrtle warblers, clad in the faded yellow
of their winter plumage. In favoured localities
these brave little birds may even spend the
entire winter with us.</p>
<p>One of the best of November&#8217;s surprises may
come when all hope of late migrants has been
given up. Walking near the river, our glance falls
on what might be a painter&#8217;s palate with blended
colours of all shades resting on the smooth surface
of the water. We look again and again,
hardly believing our eyes, until at last the gorgeous
creature takes to wing, and goes humming
down the stream, a bit of colour tropical in its
extravagance&mdash;and we know that we have seen
a male wood, or summer, duck in the full grandeur
of his white, purple, chestnut, black, blue, and
brown. Many other ducks have departed, but this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
one still swims among the floating leaves on secluded
waterways.</p>
<p>Now is the time when the woodcock rises from
his swampy summer home and zigzags his way to
a land where earthworms are still active. Sometimes
in our walks we may find the fresh body
of one of these birds, and an upward glance at the
roadside will show the cause&mdash;the cruel telegraph
wires against which the flight of the bird has carried
it with fatal velocity.</p>
<p>One of the greatest pleasures which November
has to give us is the joy of watching for the long
lines of wild geese from the Canada lakes. Who
can help being thrilled at the sight of these strong-winged
birds, as the V-shaped flock throbs into
view high in air, beating over land and water,
forest and city, as surely and steadily as the passing
of the day behind them. One of the finest of
November sounds is the &#8220;Honk! honk!&#8221; which
comes to our ears from such a company of geese,&mdash;musical
tones &#8220;like a clanking chain drawn
through the heavy air.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the stroke of midnight I have been halted in
my hurried walk by these notes. They are a bit
of the wild north which may even enter within a
city, and three years ago I trapped a fine gander
and a half a dozen of his flock in the New York
Zoological Park, where they have lived ever since
and reared their golden-hued goslings, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
otherwise would have broken their shells on some
Arctic waste, with only the snowbirds to admire,
and to be watched with greedy eyes by the Arctic
owls.</p>

without doubt the tamest of all of our wild
animals, and shares with the weasel and mink
the honour of being one of the most abundant of
the carnivores, or flesh-eaters, near our homes.
This is a great achievement for the skunk,&mdash;to
have thus held its own in the face of ever advancing
and destroying civilisation. But the same
characteristics which enable it to hold its ground
are also those which emancipate it from its wild
kindred and give it a unique position among animals.
Its first cousins, the minks and weasels,
all secrete pungent odours, which are unpleasant
enough at close range, but in the skunk the great
development of these glands has caused a radical
change in its habits of life and even in its physical
make-up.</p>
<p>Watch a mink creeping on its sinuous way,&mdash;every
action and glance full of fierce wildness,
each step telling of insatiable seeking after living,
active prey. The boldest rat flees in frantic
terror at the hint of this animal&#8217;s presence; but
let man show himself, and with a demoniacal grin
of hatred the mink slinks into covert.</p>
<p>Now follow a skunk in its wanderings as it
comes out of its hole in early evening, slowly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
stretches and yawns, and with hesitating, rolling
gait ambles along, now and then sniffing in the
grass and seizing some sluggish grasshopper or
cricket. Fearlessness and confidence are what its
gait and manner spell. The world is its debtor,
and all creatures in its path are left unmolested,
only on evidence of good behaviour. Far from
need of concealment, its furry coat is striped
with a broad band of white, signalling in the
dusk or the moonlight, &#8220;Give me room to pass
and go in peace! Trouble me and beware!&#8221;</p>
<p>Degenerate in muscles and vitality, the skunk
must forego all strenuous hunts and trust to craft
and sudden springs, or else content himself with
the humble fare of insects, helpless young birds,
and poor, easily confused mice. The flesh of the
skunk is said to be sweet and toothsome, but few
creatures there are who dare attempt to add it to
their bill of fare! A great horned owl or a puma
in the extremity of starvation, or a vulture in dire
stress of hunger,&mdash;probably no others.</p>
<p>Far from wilfully provoking an attack, the
skunk is usually content to go on his way peacefully,
and when one of these creatures becomes
accustomed to the sight of an observer, no more
interesting and, indeed, safer object of study can
be found.</p>
<p>Depart once from the conventional mode of
greeting a skunk,&mdash;and instead of hurling a stone
in its direction and fleeing, place, if the opportunity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
present itself, bits of meat in its way evening
after evening, and you will soon learn that
there is nothing vicious in the heart of the skunk.
The evening that the gentle animal appears leading
in her train a file of tiny infant skunks, you
will feel well repaid for the trouble you have
taken. Baby skunks, like their elders, soon learn
to know their friends, and are far from being at
hair-trigger poise, as is generally supposed.</p>

<h2>THE LESSON OF THE WAVE</h2>
</div>

<p>The sea and the sky and the shore were at
perfect peace on the day when the young
gull first launched into the air, and flew outward
over the green, smooth ocean. Day after day his
parents had brought him fish and squid, until his
baby plumage fell from him and his beautiful
wing-feathers shot forth,&mdash;clean-webbed and elastic.
His strong feet had carried him for days over
the expanse of sand dunes and pebbles, and now
and then he had paddled into deep pools and
bathed in the cold salt water. Most creatures of
the earth are limited to one or the other of these
two elements, but now the gull was proving his
mastery over a third. The land, the sea, were left
below, and up into the air drifted the beautiful
bird, every motion confident with the instinct of
ages.</p>
<p>The usefulness of his mother&#8217;s immaculate
breast now becomes apparent. A school of small
fish basking near the surface rise and fall with
the gentle undulating swell, seeing dimly overhead
the blue sky, flecked with hosts of fleecy
white clouds. A nearer, swifter cloud approaches,
hesitates, splashes into their midst,&mdash;and the parent
gull has caught her first fish of the day. Instinctively
the young bird dives; in his joy of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
very life he cries aloud,&mdash;the gull-cry which his
ancestors of long ago have handed down to him.
At night he seeks the shore and tucks his bill
into his plumage; and all because of something
within him, compelling him to do these things.</p>
<p>But far from being an automaton, his bright
eye and full-rounded head presage higher things.
Occasionally his mind breaks through the mist of
instinct and reaches upward to higher activity.</p>
<p>As with the other wild kindred of the ocean,
food was the chief object of the day&#8217;s search.
Fish were delicious, but were not always to be
had; crabs were a treat indeed, when caught unawares,
but for mile after mile along the coast
were hosts of mussels and clams,&mdash;sweet and
lucious, but incased in an armour of shell, through
which there was no penetrating. However swift
a dash was made upon one of these,&mdash;always the
clam closed a little quicker, sending a derisive
shower of drops over the head of the gull.</p>
<p>Once, after a week of rough weather, the storm
gods brought their battling to a climax. Great
green walls of foaming water crashed upon the
rocks, rending huge boulders and sucking them
down into the black depths. Over and through the
spray dashed the gull, answering the wind&#8217;s howl&mdash;shriek
for shriek, poising over the fearful battlefield
of sea and shore.</p>
<p>A wave mightier than all hung and curved, and
a myriad shell-fish were torn from their sheltered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
nooks and hurled high, in air, to fall broken and
helpless among the boulders. The quick eye of
the gull saw it all, and at that instant of intensest
chaos of the elements, the brain of the bird found
itself.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward came night and sleep, but the
new-found flash of knowledge was not lost.</p>
<p>The next day the bird walked at low tide into
the stronghold of the shell-fish, roughly tore one
from the silky strands of its moorings, and carrying
it far upward let it fall at random among the
rocks. The toothsome morsel was snatched from
its crushed shell and a triumphant scream told of
success,&mdash;a scream which, could it have been
interpreted, should have made a myriad, myriad
mussels shrink within their shells!</p>
<p>From gull to gull, and from flock to flock, the
new habit spread, imitation taking instant advantage
of this new source of food. When to-day
we walk along the shore and see flocks of gulls
playing ducks and drakes with the unfortunate
shell-fish, give them not too much credit, but think
of some bird which in the long ago first learned
the lesson, whether by chance or, as I have suggested,
by observing the victims of the waves.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>No scientific facts are these, but merely a logical
reasoning deduced from the habits and traits
of the birds as we know them to-day; a theory to
hold in mind while we watch for its confirmation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
in the beginning of other new and analogous
habits.</p>

<h2>WE GO A-SPONGING</h2>
</div>

<p>When a good compound microscope becomes
as common an object in our homes as is
a clock or a piano, we may be certain that the succeeding
generation will grow up with a much
broader view of life and a far greater realisation
of the beauties of the natural world. To most of
us a glance through a microscope is almost as
unusual a sight as the panorama from a balloon.
While many of the implements of a scientist
arouse enthusiasm only in himself, in the case of
the revelations of this instrument, the average
person, whatever his profession, cannot fail to
be interested.</p>
<p>Many volumes have been written on the microscopic
life of ponds and fields, and in a short essay
only a hint of the delights of this fascinating study
can be given.</p>
<p>Any primer of Natural History will tell us that
our bath sponges are the fibrous skeletons of
aquatic animals which inhabit tropical seas, but
few people know that in the nearest pond there
are real sponges, growing sometimes as large as
one&#8217;s head and which are not very dissimilar to
those taken from among the corals of the
Bahamas. We may bring home a twig covered
with a thick growth of this sponge; and by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
dropping a few grains of carmine into the water,
the currents which the little sponge animals set
up are plainly visible. In winter these all die, and
leave within their meshes numbers of tiny winter
buds, which survive the cold weather and in the
spring begin to found new colonies. If we examine
the sponges in the late fall we may find
innumerable of these statoblasts, as they are
called.</p>
<p>Scattered among them will sometimes be
crowds of little wheels, surrounded with double-ended
hooks. These have no motion and we shall
probably pass them by as minute burrs or seeds
of some water plant. But they, too, are winter
buds of a strange group of tiny animals. These
are known as Polyzoans or Bryozoans; and though
to the eye a large colony of them appears only as
a mass of thick jelly, yet when placed in water
and left quiet, a wonderful transformation comes
over the bit of gelatine.... &#8220;Perhaps while you
gaze at the reddish jelly a pink little projection
appears within the field of your lens, and slowly
lengthens and broadens, retreating and reappearing,
it may be, many times, but finally, after much
hesitation, it suddenly seems to burst into bloom.
A narrow body, so deeply red that it is often
almost crimson, lifts above the jelly a crescentic
disc ornamented with two rows of long tentacles
that seem as fine as hairs, and they glisten and
sparkle like lines of crystal as they wave and float
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
and twist the delicate threads beneath your
wondering gaze. Then, while you scarcely
breathe, for fear the lovely vision will fade,
another and another spreads its disc and waves its
silvery tentacles, until the whole surface of that
ugly jelly mass blooms like a garden in Paradise&mdash;blooms
not with motionless perianths, but with
living animals, the most exquisite that God has
allowed to develop in our sweet waters.&#8221; At the
slightest jar every animal-flower vanishes
instantly.</p>
<p>A wonderful history is behind these little creatures
and very different from that of most members
of the animal kingdom. While crabs, butterflies,
and birds have evolved through many and
varied ancestral forms, the tiny Bryozoans, or,
being interpreted, moss-animals, seem throughout
all past ages to have found a niche for themselves
where strenuous and active competition is absent.
Year after year, century upon century, age upon
age, they have lived and died, almost unchanged
down to the present day. When you look at the
tiny animal, troubling the water and drawing its
inconceivably small bits of food toward it upon
the current made by its tentacles, think of the
earth changes which it has survived.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge the Age of Man
is but a paltry fifty thousand years. Behind this
the Age of Mammals may have numbered three
millions; then back of these came the Age of Reptiles
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
with more than seven millions of years, during
all of which time the tentacles of unnumbered
generations of Bryozoans waved in the sea. Back,
back farther still we add another seven million
years, or thereabouts, of the Age of the Amphibians,
when the coal plants grew, and the Age of
the Fishes. And finally, beyond all exact human
calculation, but estimated at some five million,
we reach the Age of Invertebrates in the Silurian,
and in the lowest of these rocks we find beautifully
preserved fossils of Bryozoans, to all appearances
as perfect in detail of structure as these which we
have before us to-day in this twentieth century
of man&#8217;s brief reckoning.</p>
<p>These tiny bits of jelly are transfigured as well
by the grandeur of their unchanged lineage as by
the appearance of the little animals from within.
What heraldry can commemorate the beginning
of their race over twenty millions of years in the
past!</p>
<p>The student of mythology will feel at home
when identifying some of the commonest objects
of the pond. And most are well named, too, as
for instance the Hydra, a small tube-shaped creature
with a row of active tentacles at one end.
Death seems far from this organism, which is
closely related to the sea-anemones and corals,
for though a very brief drying will serve to kill
it, yet it can be sliced and cut as finely as possible
and each bit, true to its name, will at once proceed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
to grow a new head and tentacles complete, becoming
a perfect animal.</p>
<p>Then we shall often come across a queer creature
with two oar-like feelers near the head and
a double tail tipped with long hairs, while in the
centre of the head is a large, shining eye,&mdash;Cyclops
he is rightly called. Although so small
that we can make out little of his structure without
the aid of the lens, yet Cyclops is far from
being related to the other still smaller beings
which swim about him, many of which consist of
but one cell and are popularly known as animalculæ,
more correctly as Protozoans. Cyclops has
a jointed body and in many other ways shows his
relationship to crabs and lobsters, even though
they are many times larger and live in salt water.</p>
<p>Another member of this group is Daphnia,
although the appropriateness of this name yet
remains to be discovered; Daphnia being a chunky-bodied
little being, with a double-branched pair of
oar-like appendages, with which he darts swiftly
through the water. Although covered with a hard
crust like a crab, this is so transparent that we
can see right through his body. The dark mass
of food in the stomach and the beating heart are
perfectly distinct. Often, near the upper part of
the body, several large eggs are seen in a sort of
pouch, where they are kept until hatched.</p>
<p>So if the sea is far away and time hangs heavy,
invite your friends to go sponging and crabbing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
in the nearest pond, and you may be certain of
quieting their fears as to your sanity as well as
drawing exclamations of delight from them when
they see these beautiful creatures for the first
time.</p>

<h2>NEW THOUGHTS ABOUT NESTS</h2>
</div>

<p>Our sense of smell is not so keen as that of a
dog, who can detect the tiny quail while
they are still invisible; nor have we the piercing
sight of the eagle who spies the grouse crouching
hundreds of feet beneath his circling flight; but
when we walk through the bare December woods
there is unfolded at last to our eyes evidence of
the late presence of our summer&#8217;s feathered
friends&mdash;air castles and tree castles of varied patterns
and delicate workmanship.</p>
<p>Did it ever occur to you to think what the first
nest was like&mdash;what home the first reptile-like
scale flutterers chose? Far back before Jurassic
times, millions of years ago, before the coming of
bony fishes, when the only mammals were tiny
nameless creatures, hardly larger than mice;
when the great Altantosaurus dinosaurs browsed
on the quaint herbage, and Pterodactyls&mdash;those
ravenous bat-winged dragons of the air&mdash;hovered
above the surface of the earth,&mdash;in this epoch we
can imagine a pair of long-tailed, half-winged
creatures which skimmed from tree to tree, perhaps
giving an occasional flop&mdash;the beginning of
the marvellous flight motions. Is it not likely that
the Teleosaurs who watched hungrily from the
swamps saw them disappear at last in a hollowed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
cavity beneath a rotten knothole? Here, perhaps,
the soft-shelled, lizard-like eggs were laid, and
when they gave forth the ugly creaturelings did
not Father Creature flop to the topmost branch
and utter a gurgling cough, a most unpleasant
grating sound, but grand in its significance, as
the opening chord in the symphony of the ages to
follow?&mdash;until now the mockingbird and the nightingale
hold us spellbound by the wonder of their
minstrelsy.</p>
<p>Turning from our imaginary picture of the ancient
days, we find that some of the birds of the
present time have found a primitive way of nesting
still the best. If we push over this rotten
stump we shall find that the cavity near the top,
where the wood is still sound, has been used the
past summer by the downy woodpecker&mdash;a front
door like an auger hole, ceiling of rough-hewn
wood, a bed of chips!</p>
<p>The chickadee goes a step further, and shows
his cleverness in sometimes choosing a cavity
already made, and instead of rough, bare chips,
the six or eight chickadee youngsters are happy
on a hair mattress of a closely woven felt-like
substance.</p>
<p>Perhaps we should consider the kingfisher the
most barbarous of all the birds which form a shelter
for their home. With bill for pick and shovel,
she bores straight into a sheer clay bank, and at
the end of a six-foot tunnel her young are reared,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
their nest a mass of fish bones&mdash;the residue of
their dinners. Then there are the aerial masons
and brickmakers&mdash;the eave swallows, who carry
earth up into the air, bit by bit, and attach it to
the eaves, forming it into a globular, long-necked
flask. The barn swallows mix the clay with straw
and feathers and so form very firm structures on
the rafters above the haymows.</p>
<p>But what of the many nests of grasses and
twigs which we find in the woods? How closely
they were concealed while the leaves were on the
trees, and how firm and strong they were while in
use, the strongest wind and rain of summer only
rocking them to and fro! But now we must waste
no time or they will disappear. In a month or
more almost all will have dissolved into fragments
and fallen to earth&mdash;their mission accomplished.</p>
<p>Some look as if disintegration had already
begun, but if we had discovered them earlier in
the year, we should have seen that they were
never less fragile or loosely constructed than we
find them now. Such is a cuckoo&#8217;s nest, such a
mourning dove&#8217;s or a heron&#8217;s; merely a flat platform
of a few interlaced twigs, through which the
eggs are visible from below. Why, we ask, are
some birds so careless or so unskilful? The
European cuckoo, like our cowbird, is a parasite,
laying her eggs in the nests of other birds; so,
perhaps, neglect of household duties is in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
blood. But this style of architecture seems to
answer all the requirements of doves and herons,
and, although with one sweep of the hand we can
demolish one of these flimsy platforms, yet such
a nest seems somehow to resist wind and rain just
as long as the bird needs it.</p>
<p>Did you ever try to make a nest yourself? If
not, sometime take apart a discarded nest&mdash;even
the simplest in structure&mdash;and try to put it
together again. Use no string or cord, but fasten
it to a crotch, put some marbles in it and visit it
after the first storm. After you have picked up
all the marbles from the ground you will appreciate
more highly the skill which a bird shows in
the construction of its home. Whether a bird
excavates its nest in earth or wood, or weaves or
plasters it, the work is all done by means of two
straight pieces of horn&mdash;the bill.</p>
<p>There is, however, one useful substance which
aids the bird&mdash;the saliva which is formed in the
mucous glands of the mouth. Of course the first
and natural function of this fluid is to soften the
food before it passes into the crop; but in those
birds which make their nests by weaving together
pieces of twig, it must be of great assistance in
softening the wood and thus enabling the bird
readily to bend the twigs into any required position.
Thus the catbird and rose-breasted grosbeak
weave.</p>
<p>Given a hundred or more pieces of twigs, each
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
an inch in length, even a bird would make but
little progress in forming a cup-shaped nest, were
it not that the sticky saliva provided cement
strong and ready at hand. So the chimney swift
finds no difficulty in forming and attaching her
mosaic of twigs to a chimney, using only very
short twigs which she breaks off with her feet
while she is on the wing.</p>
<p>How wonderfully varied are the ways which
birds adopt to conceal their nests. Some avoid
suspicion by their audacity, building near a frequented
path, in a spot which they would never
be suspected of choosing. The hummingbird studs
the outside of its nest with lichens, and the vireo
drapes a cobweb curtain around her fairy cup.
Few nests are more beautiful and at the same time
more durable than a vireo&#8217;s. I have seen the
nests of three successive years in the same tree,
all built, no doubt, by the same pair of birds, the
nest of the past summer perfect in shape and
quality, that of the preceding year threadbare,
while the home which sheltered the brood of three
summers ago is a mere flattened skeleton, reminding
one of the ribs and stern post of a wrecked
boat long pounded by the waves.</p>
<p>The subject of nests has been sadly neglected
by naturalists, most of whom have been chiefly
interested in the owners or the contents; but when
the whys and wherefores of the homes of birds
are made plain we shall know far more concerning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
the little carpenters, weavers, masons, and
basket-makers who hang our groves and decorate
our shrubbery with their skill. When on our winter&#8217;s
walk we see a distorted, wind-torn, grass cup,
think of the quartet of beautiful little creatures,
now flying beneath some tropical sun, which owe
their lives to the nest, and which, if they are
spared, will surely return to the vicinity next
summer.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
<h2>LESSONS FROM AN ENGLISH SPARROW</h2>
</div>

<p>Many people say they love Nature, but as
they have little time to go into the country
they have to depend on books for most of their
information concerning birds, flowers, and other
forms of life. There is, however, no reason why
one should not, even in the heart of a great city,
begin to cultivate his powers of observation. Let
us take, for example, the omnipresent English
sparrow. Most of us probably know the difference
between the male and female English sparrows,
but I venture to say that not one in ten persons
could give a satisfactory description of the colours
of either. How much we look and how little we
really see!</p>
<p>Little can be said in favour of the English sparrows&#8217;
disposition, but let us not blame them for
their unfortunate increase in numbers. Man
brought them from England, where they are kept
in check by Nature&#8217;s wise laws. These birds were
deliberately introduced where Nature was not
prepared for them.</p>
<p>When we put aside prejudice we can see that
the male bird, especially when in his bright spring
colours, is really very attractive, with his ashy
gray head, his back streaked with black and bay,
the white bar on his wings and the jet black chin
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
and throat contrasting strongly with the uniformly
light-coloured under parts. If this were
a rare bird the &#8220;black-throated sparrow&#8221; would
enjoy his share of admiration.</p>
<p>It is wonderful how he can adapt himself to new
conditions, nesting anywhere and everywhere, and
this very adaptation is a sign of a very high order
of intelligence. He has, however, many characteristics
which tell us of his former life. A few of
the habits of this bird may be misleading. His
thick, conical bill is made for crushing seeds, but
he now feeds on so many different substances that
its original use, as shown by its shape, is obscured.
If there were such a thing as vaudeville among
birds, the common sparrow would be a star imitator.
He clings to the bark of trees and picks out
grubs, supporting himself with his tail like a
woodpecker; he launches out into the air, taking
insects on the wing like a flycatcher; he clings like
a chickadee to the under side of twigs, or hovers
in front of a heap of insect eggs, presenting a
feeble imitation of a hummingbird. These modes
of feeding represent many different families of
birds.</p>
<p>Although his straw and feather nests are shapeless
affairs, and he often feeds on garbage, all
æsthetic feeling is not lost, as we see when he
swells out his black throat and white cravat,
spreads tail and wing and beseeches his lady-love
to admire him. Thus he woos her as long as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
is alone, but when several other eager suitors
arrive, his patience gives out, and the courting
turns into a football game. Rough and tumble is
the word, but somehow in the midst of it all, her
highness manages to make her mind known and
off she flies with the lucky one. Thus we have
represented, in the English sparrows, the two extremes
of courtship among birds.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the male alone is ornamented,
the colours of the female being much
plainer. This dates from a time when it was
necessary for the female to be concealed while
sitting on the eggs. The young of both sexes are
coloured like their mother, the young males not
acquiring the black gorget until perfectly able to
take care of themselves. About the plumage there
are some interesting facts. The young bird moults
twice before the first winter. The second moult
brings out the mark on the throat, but it is rusty
now, not black in colour; his cravat is grayish and
the wing bar ashy. In the spring, however, a
noticeable change takes place, but neither by the
moulting nor the coming in of plumage. The
shaded edges of the feathers become brittle and
break off, bringing out the true colours and making
them clear and brilliant. The waistcoat is
brushed until it is black and glossy, the cravat
becomes immaculate, and the wristband or wing
bar clears up until it is pure white.</p>
<p>The homes of these sparrows are generally composed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
of a great mass of straw and feathers, with
the nest in the centre; but the spotted eggs, perhaps,
show that these birds once built open nests,
the dots and marks on the eggs being of use in
concealing their conspicuous white ground. Something
seems already to have hinted to Nature that
this protection is no longer necessary, and we
often find eggs almost white, like those of woodpeckers
and owls, which nest in dark places.</p>
<p>We have all heard of birds flocking together for
some mutual benefit&mdash;the crows, for instance,
which travel every winter day across country to
favourite &#8220;roosts.&#8221; In the heart of a city we can
often study this same phenomenon of birds
gathering together in great flocks. In New York
City, on One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street,
there stands a tree&mdash;a solitary reminder of the
forest which once covered all this paved land.
To this, all winter long, the sparrows begin to
flock about four or five o&#8217;clock in the afternoon.
They come singly and in twos and threes until
the bare limbs are black with them and there
seems not room for another bird; but still they
come, each new arrival diving into the mass of
birds and causing a local commotion. By seven
o&#8217;clock there are hundreds of English sparrows
perching in this one tree. At daylight they are
off again, whirring away by scores, and in a few
minutes the tree is silent and empty. The same
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
habit is to be seen in many other cities and towns,
for thus the birds gain mutual warmth.</p>
<p>Nature will do her best to diminish the number
of sparrows and to regain the balance, but to do
this the sparrow must be brought face to face with
as many dangers as our wild birds, and although,
owing to the sparrows&#8217; fearlessness of man, this
may never happen, yet at least the colour protections
and other former safeguards are slowly
being eliminated. On almost every street we may
see albino or partly albino birds, such as those
with white tails or wings. White birds exist in a
wild state only from some adaptation to their surroundings.
A bird which is white simply because
its need of protection has temporarily ceased,
would become the prey of the first stray hawk
which crossed its path. We cannot hope to
exterminate the English sparrow even by the most
wholesale slaughter, but if some species of small
hawk or butcher bird could ever become as fearless
an inhabitant of our cities as these birds,
their reduction to reasonable numbers would be a
matter of only a few months.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
<h2>THE PERSONALITY OF TREES</h2>
</div>

<p>How many of us think of trees almost as we
do of the rocks and stones about us,&mdash;as all
but inanimate objects, standing in the same relation
to our earth as does the furry covering of an
animal to its owner. The simile might be carried
out more in detail, the forests protecting the continents
from drought and flood, even as the coat
of fur protects its owner from extremes of heat
and cold.</p>
<p>When we come to consider the tree as a living
individual, a form of life contemporaneous with
our own, and to realise that it has its birth and
death, its struggles for life and its periods of
peace and abundance, we will soon feel for it a
keener sympathy and interest and withal a veneration
greater than it has ever aroused in us
before.</p>
<p>Of all living things on earth, a tree binds us
most closely to the past. Some of the giant tortoises
of the Galapagos Islands are thought to be
four hundred years old and are probably the
oldest animals on the earth. There is, however,
nothing to compare with the majesty and
grandeur of the Sequoias&mdash;the giant redwoods of
California&mdash;the largest of which, still living,
reach upward more than one hundred yards above
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
the ground, and show, by the number of their
rings, that their life began from three to five
thousand years ago. Our deepest feelings of
reverence are aroused when we look at a tree
which was &#8220;one thousand years old when Homer
wrote the Iliad; fifteen hundred years of age when
Aristotle was foreshadowing his evolution theory
and writing his history of animals; two thousand
years of age when Christ walked upon earth;
nearly four thousand years of age when the
&#8216;Origin of Species&#8217; was written. Thus the life of
one of these trees spanned the whole period before
the birth of Aristotle (384 <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>B.C.</span>) and after the
death of Darwin (<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A.D.</span> 1882), the two greatest natural
philosophers who have lived.&#8221;</p>
<p>Considered not only individually, but taken as a
group, the Sequoias are among the oldest of the
old. Geologically speaking, most of the forms of
life now in existence are of recent origin, but a
full ten million of years ago these giant trees were
developed almost as highly as they are to-day. At
the end of the coal period, when the birds and
mammals of to-day were as yet unevolved, existing
only potentially in the scaly, reptile-like creatures
of those days, the Sequoias waved their
needles high in air.</p>
<p>In those days these great trees were found over
the whole of Canada, Greenland, and Siberia, but
the relentless onslaught of the Ice Age wrought
terrible destruction and, like the giant tortoises
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
among reptiles, the apteryx among birds, and the
bison among mammals, the forlorn hope of the
great redwoods, making a last stand in a few
small groves of California, awaits total extinction
at the hands of the most terrible of Nature&#8217;s
enemies&mdash;man. When the last venerable giant
trunk has fallen, the last axe-stroke which severs
the circle of vital sap will cut the only thread of
individual life which joins in time the beating of
our pulses to-day with the beginning of human
history and philosophy,&mdash;thousands of years in
the past.</p>
<p>Through all the millions of years during which
the evolution of modern forms of life has been
going on, then as now, trees must have entered
prominently into the environment and lives of the
terrestrial animals. Ages ago, long before snakes
and four-toed horses were even foreshadowed,
and before the first bird-like creatures had appeared,
winged reptile-dragons flew about, doubtless
roosting or perching on the Triassic and
Jurassic trees. Perhaps the very pieces of coal
which are burned in our furnaces once bent and
swayed under the weight of these bulky animals.
Something like six millions of years ago, long-tailed,
fluttering birds appeared, with lizard-like
claws at the bend of their wings and with jaws
filled with teeth. These creatures were certainly
arboreal, spending most of their time among the
branches of trees. So large were certain great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
sloth-like creatures that they uprooted the trees
bodily, in order to feed on their succulent leaves,
sometimes bending their trunks down until their
branches were within reach.</p>
<p>On a walk through the woods and fields to-day,
how seldom do we find a dead insect! When sick
and dying, nine out of ten are snapped up by frog,
lizard, or bird; the few which die a natural death
seeming to disintegrate into mould within a very
short space of time. There is, however, one way
in which, through the long, long thousands of centuries,
insects have been preserved. The spicy
resin which flowed from the ancient pines
attracted hosts of insects, which, tempted by their
hope of food, met their death&mdash;caught and slowly
but surely enclosed by the viscid sap, each antenna
and hair as perfect as when the insect was alive.
Thus, in this strangely fortunate way, we may
know and study the insects which, millions of
years ago, fed on the flowers or bored into the
bark of trees. We have found no way to improve
on Nature in this respect, for to-day when we
desire to mount a specimen permanently for
microscopical work, we imbed it in Canada
balsam.</p>
<p>If suddenly the earth should be bereft of all
trees, there would indeed be consternation and
despair among many classes of animals. Although
in the sea there are thousands of creatures,
which, by their manner of life, are prohibited
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
from ever passing the boundary line between land
and water, yet many sea-worms, as for example
the teredo, or ship-worm, are especially fashioned
for living in and perhaps feeding on wood,
in the shape of stray floating trees and branches,
the bottoms of ships, and piles of wharves. Of
course the two latter are supplied by man, but
even before his time, floating trees at sea must
have been plentiful enough to supply homes for
the whole tribe of these creatures, unless they
made their burrows in coral or shells.</p>
<p>The insects whose very existence, in some cases,
depends upon trees, are innumerable. What, for
example, would become of the larvæ of the cicada,
or locust, which, in the cold and darkness of their
subterranean life, for seventeen years suck the
juicy roots of trees; or the caterpillars of the
moths, spinning high their webs among the leaves;
or the countless beetles whose grubs bore through
and through the trunk their sinuous, sawdusty
tunnels; or the ichneumon fly, which with an
instrument&mdash;surgical needle, file, augur, and scroll
saw all in one&mdash;deposits, deep below the bark, its
eggs in safety? If forced to compete with terrestrial
species, the tree spiders and scorpions would
quickly become exterminated; while especially
adapted arboreal ants would instantly disappear.</p>
<p>We cannot entirely exclude even fishes from our
list; as the absence of mangroves would incidentally
affect the climbing perch and catfishes!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
The newts and common toads would be in no wise
dismayed by the passing of the trees, but not so
certain tadpoles. Those of our ditches, it is true,
would live and flourish, but there are, in the world,
many curious kinds which hatch and grow up into
frogs in curled-up leaves or in damp places in
the forks of branches, and which would find themselves
homeless without trees. Think, too, of the
poor green and brown tree frogs with their sucker
feet, compelled always to hop along the ground!</p>
<p>Lizards, from tiny swifts to sixty-inch iguanas,
would sorely miss the trees, while the lithe green
tree snakes and the tree boas would have to
change all their life habits in order to be able to
exist. But as for the cold, uncanny turtles and
alligators,&mdash;what are trees to them!</p>
<p>In the evolution of the birds and other animals,
the cry of &#8220;excelsior&#8221; has been followed literally
as well as theoretically and, with a few exceptions,
the highest in each class have not only risen above
their fellows in intelligence and structure, but
have left the earth and climbed or flown to the
tree-tops, making these their chief place of abode.</p>
<p>Many of the birds which find their food at sea,
or in the waters of stream and lake, repair to the
trees for the purpose of building their nests
among the branches. Such birds are the pelicans,
herons, ibises, and ospreys; while the wood ducks
lay their eggs high above the ground in the hollows
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
of trees. Parrots, kingfishers, swifts, and
hummingbirds are almost helpless on the ground,
their feet being adapted for climbing about the
branches, perching on twigs, or clinging to the
hollows of trees. Taken as a whole, birds would
suffer more than any other class of creatures in a
deforested world. The woodpeckers would be
without home, food, and resting-place; except,
possibly, the flicker, or high-hole, who is either a
retrograde or a genius, whichever we may choose
to consider him, and could live well enough upon
ground ants. But as to his nest&mdash;he would have to
sharpen his wits still more to solve successfully
the question of the woodpecker motto, &#8220;What is
home without a hollow tree?&#8221;</p>
<p>Great gaps would be made in the ranks of the
furry creatures&mdash;the mammals. Opossums and
raccoons would find themselves in an embarrassing
position, and as for the sloths, which never
descend to earth, depending for protection on their
resemblance to leaves and mossy bark, they would
be wiped out with one fell swoop. The arboreal
squirrels might learn to burrow, as so many of
their near relations have done, but their muscles
would become cramped from inactivity and their
eyes would often strain upward for a glimpse of
the beloved branches. The bats might take to
caves and the vampires to outhouses and dark
crevices in the rocks, but most of the monkeys and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
apes would soon become extinct, while a chimpanzee
or orang-utan would become a cripple,
swinging ever painfully along between the
knuckles of crutch-like forearms, searching,
searching forever for the trees which gave him
his form and structure, and without which his life
and that of his race must abruptly end.</p>
<p>Leaving the relations which trees hold to the
animals about them and the part which they have
played in the evolution of life on the earth in past
epochs, let us consider some of the more humble
trees about us. Not, however, from the standpoint
of the technical botanist or the scientific forester,
but from the sympathetic point of view of a living
fellow form, sharing the same planet, both
owing their lives to the same great source of all
light and heat, and subject to the same extremes
of heat and cold, storm and drought. How
wonderful, when we come to think of it, is a tree,
to be able to withstand its enemies, elemental and
animate, year after year, decade after decade,
although fast-rooted to one patch of earth. An
animal flees to shelter at the approach of gale or
cyclone, or travels far in search of abundant food.
Like the giant algæ, ever waving upward from the
bed of the sea, which depend on the nourishment
of the surrounding waters, so the tree blindly
trusts to Nature to minister to its needs, filling its
leaves with the light-given greenness, and feeling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
for nutritious salts with the sensitive tips of its
innumerable rootlets.</p>
<p>Darwin has taught us, and truly, that a relentless
struggle for existence is ever going on around
us, and although this is most evident to our eyes
in a terrible death battle between two great beasts
of prey, yet it is no less real and intense in the
case of the bird pouring forth a beautiful song, or
the delicate violet shedding abroad its perfume.
To realise the host of enemies ever shadowing the
feathered songster and its kind, we have only to
remember that though four young birds may be
hatched in each of fifty nests, yet of the two hundred
nestlings an average often of but one lives
to grow to maturity,&mdash;to migrate and to return to
the region of its birth.</p>
<p>And the violet, living, apparently, such a quiet
life of humble sweetness? Fortunate indeed is it
if its tiny treasure of seeds is fertilized, and then
the chances are a thousand to one that they will
grow and ripen only to fall by the wayside, or on
barren ground, or among the tares.</p>
<p>At first thought, a tree seems far removed from
all such struggles. How solemn and grand its
trunk stands, column-like against the sky! How
puny and weak we seem beside it! Its sturdy
roots, sound wood, and pliant branches all spell
power. Nevertheless, the old, old struggle is as
fierce, as unending, here as everywhere. A monarch
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
of the forest has gained its supremacy only
by a lifelong battle with its own kind and with a
horde of alien enemies.</p>
<p>From the heart of the tropics to the limit of
tree-growth in the northland we find the battle of
life waged fiercely, root contending with root for
earth-food, branch with branch for the light which
means life.</p>
<p>In a severe wrestling match, the moments of
supremest strain are those when the opponents
are fast-locked, motionless, when the advantage
comes, not with quickness, but with staying
power; and likewise in the struggle of tree with
tree the fact that one or two years, or even whole
decades, watch the efforts of the branches to lift
their leaves one above the other, detracts nothing
from the bitterness of the strife.</p>
<p>Far to the north we will sometimes find groves
of young balsam firs or spruce,&mdash;hundreds of the
same species of sapling growing so close together
that a rabbit may not pass between. The slender
trunks, almost touching each other, are bare of
branches. Only at the top is there light and air,
and the race is ever upward. One year some slight
advantage may come to one young tree,&mdash;some
delicate unbalancing of the scales of life, and that
fortunate individual instantly responds, reaching
several slender side branches over the heads of
his brethren. They as quickly show the effects of
the lessened light and forthwith the race is at an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
end. The victor shoots up tall and straight,
stamping and choking out the lives at his side, as
surely as if his weapons were teeth and claws
instead of delicate root-fibres and soughing
foliage.</p>
<p>The contest with its fellows is only the first of
many. The same elements which help to give it
being and life are ever ready to catch it unawares,
to rend it limb from limb, or by patient, long-continued
attack bring it crashing to the very
dust from which sprang the seed.</p>
<p>We see a mighty spruce whose black leafage has
waved above its fellows for a century or more,
paying for its supremacy by the distortion of
every branch. Such are to be seen clinging to the
rocky shores of Fundy, every branch and twig
curved toward the land; showing the years of
battling with constant gales and blizzards. Like
giant weather-vanes they stand, and, though there
is no elasticity in their limbs and they are gnarled
and scarred, yet our hearts warm in admiration
of their decades of patient watching beside the
troubled waters. For years to come they will
defy every blast the storm god can send against
them, until, one wild day, when the soil has grown
scanty around the roots of one of the weakest, it
will shiver and tremble at some terrific onslaught
of wind and sleet; it will fold its branches closer
about it and, like the Indian chieftains, who perhaps
in years past occasionally watched the waters
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
by the side of the young sapling, the conquered
tree will bow its head for the last time to
the storm.</p>
<p>Farther inland, sheltered in a narrow valley,
stands a sister tree, seeded from the same cone as
the storm-distorted spruce. The wind shrieks and
howls above the little valley and cannot enter; but
the law of compensation brings to bear another
element, silent, gentle, but as deadly as the howling
blast of the gale. All through the long winter
the snow sifts softly down, finding easy lodgment
on the dense-foliaged branches. From the surrounding
heights the white crystals pour down
until the tree groans with the massive weight.
Her sister above is battling with the storm, but
hardly a feather&#8217;s weight of snow clings to her
waving limbs.</p>
<p>The compressed, down-bent branches of the valley
spruce soon become permanently bent and the
strain on the trunk fibres is great. At last, with a
despairing crash, one great limb gives way and is
torn bodily from its place of growth. The very
vitals of the tree are exposed and instantly every
splintered cell is filled with the sifting snow.
Helpless the tree stands, and early in the spring,
at the first quickening of summer&#8217;s growth, a salve
of curative resin is poured upon the wound. But
it is too late. The invading water has done its
work and the elements have begun to rot the very
heart of the tree. How much more to be desired is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
the manner of life and death of the first spruce,
battling to the very last!</p>
<p>A beech seedling which takes root close to the
bank of a stream has a good chance of surviving,
since there will be no competitors on the water
side and moisture and air will never fail. But
look at some ancient beech growing thus, whose
smooth, whitened hole encloses a century of
growth rings. Offsetting its advantages, the
stream, little by little, has undermined the maze
of roots and the force of annual freshets has
trained them all in a down-stream direction. It
is an inverted reminder of the wind-moulded
spruce. Although the stout beech props itself by
great roots thrown landward, yet, sooner or later,
the ripples will filter in beyond the centre of
gravity and the mighty tree will topple and mingle
with its shadow-double which for so many years
the stream has reflected.</p>
<p>Thus we find that while without moisture no
tree could exist, yet the same element often brings
death. The amphibious mangroves which fringe
the coral islands of the southern seas hardly attain
to the dignity of trees, but in the mysterious
depths of our southern swamps we find the
strangely picturesque cypresses, which defy the
waters about them. One cannot say where trunk
ends and root begins, but up from the stagnant
slime rise great arched buttresses, so that the tree
seems to be supported on giant six- or eight-legged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
stools, between the arches of which the water
flows and finds no chance to use its power. Here,
in these lonely solitudes,&mdash;heron-haunted, snake-infested,&mdash;the
hanging moss and orchids search
out every dead limb and cover it with an unnatural
greenness. Here, great lichens grow and
a myriad tropical insects bore and tunnel their
way from bark to heart of tree and back again.
Here, in the blackness of night, when the air is
heavy with hot, swampy odours, and only the
occasional squawk of a heron or cry of some animal
is heard, a rending, grinding, crashing, breaks
suddenly upon the stillness, a distant boom and
splash, awakening every creature. Then the
silence again closes down and we know that a
cypress, perhaps linking a trio of centuries, has
yielded up its life.</p>
<p>Leaving the hundred other mysteries which the
trees of the tropics might unfold, let us consider
for a moment the danger which the tall, successful
tree invites,&mdash;the penalty which it pays for
having surpassed all its other brethren. It preeminently
attracts the bolts of Jove and the lesser
trees see a blinding flash, hear a rending of heart
wood, and when the storm has passed, the tree,
before perfect in trunk, limbs, and foliage, is now
but a heap of charred splinters.</p>
<p>Many a great willow overhanging the banks of
a wide river could tell interesting tales of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
scars on its trunk. That lower wound was a deep
gash cut by some Indian, perhaps to direct a war-party
making their way through the untrodden
wilderness; this bare, unsightly patch was burnt
out by the signal fire of one of our forefather
pioneers. And so on and on the story would unfold,
until the topmost, freshly sawed-off limb had
for its purpose only the desire of the present
owner for a clearer view of the water beyond.</p>
<p>Finally we come to the tree best beloved of us
in the north,&mdash;the carefully grafted descendant of
some sour little wild crab-apple. A faithful
servant indeed has the monarch of the old orchard
proved. It has fed us and our fathers before us,
and its gnarled trunk and low-hanging branches
tell the story of the rosy fruit which has weighed
down its limbs year after year. Old age has laid
a heavy hand upon it, but not until the outermost
twig has ceased to blossom, and its death, unlike
that of its wild kindred, has come silently and
peacefully, do we give the order to have the tree
felled. Even in its death it serves us, giving back
from the open hearth the light and heat which it
has stored up throughout the summers of many
years.</p>
<p>Let us give more thought to the trees about us,
and when possible succour them in distress,
straighten the bent sapling, remove the parasitic
lichen, and give them the best chance for a long,
patient, strong life.

<h2>AN OWL OF THE NORTH</h2>
</div>

<p>It is mid-winter, and from the northland a blizzard
of icy winds and swirling snow crystals
is sweeping with fury southward over woods and
fields. We sit in our warm room before the crackling
log fire and listen to the shriek of the gale
and wonder how it fares with the little bundles of
feathers huddled among the cedar branches.</p>
<p>We picture to ourselves all the wild kindred
sheltered from the raging storm; the gray squirrels
rocking in their lofty nests of leaves; the
chipmunks snug underground; the screech owls
deep in the hollow apple trees, all warm and dry.</p>
<p>But there are those for whom the blizzard has
no terrors. Far to the north on the barren wastes
of Labrador, where the gale first comes in from
the sea and gathers strength as it comes, a great
owl flaps upward and on broad pinions, white as
the driving snowflakes, sweeps southward with
the storm. Now over ice-bound river or lake, or
rushing past a myriad dark spires of spruce, then
hovering wonderingly over a multitude of lights
from the streets of some town, the strong Arctic
bird forges southward, until one night, if we only
knew, we might open our window and, looking upward,
see two great yellow eyes apparently hanging
in space, the body and wings of the bird in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
snow-white plumage lost amidst the flakes. We
thrill in admiration at the grand bird, so fearless
of the raging elements.</p>
<p>Only the coldest and fiercest storms will tempt
him from the north, and then not because he fears
snow or cold, but in order to keep within reach of
the snowbirds which form his food. He seeks for
places where a less severe cold encourages small
birds to be abroad, or where the snow&#8217;s crust is
less icy, through which the field mice may bore
their tunnels, and run hither and thither in the
moonlight, pulling down the weeds and cracking
their frames of ice. Heedless of passing clouds,
these little rodents scamper about, until a darker,
swifter shadow passes, and the feathered talons
of the snowy owl close over the tiny, shivering
bundle of fur.</p>
<p>Occasionally after such a storm, one may come
across this white owl in some snowy field, hunting
in broad daylight; and that must go down as
a red-letter day, to be remembered for years.</p>
<p>What would one not give to know of his adventures
since he left the far north. What stories he
could tell of hunts for the ptarmigan,&mdash;those
Arctic fowl, clad in plumage as white as his own;
or the little kit foxes, or the seals and polar bears
playing the great game of life and death among
the grinding icebergs!</p>
<p>His visit to us is a short one. Comes the first
hint of a thaw and he has vanished like a melting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
snowflake, back to his home and his mate. There
in a hollow in the half-frozen Iceland moss, in
February, as many as ten fuzzy little snowy
owlets may grow up in one nest,&mdash;all as hardy and
beautiful and brave as their great fierce-eyed
parents.</p>
